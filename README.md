Hey guys, here is a somewhat coherent version of the app.

Guests can submit questions (each browser session has a unique userID I think)
Admins (username: 'thomasrr', password: 'password') can remove and toggle visibility of questions.
No way to add answers yet, we'll have to do some real coding for that and it's really late for that.

Install meteor, node.
Clone the repo
meteor npm i (first time -- also if you have npm just do npm install)
meteor
play around!

if you have to download more packages its pretty self explanatory
the server might spit out some console.log()s, check it out i guess
