##Real Talk Princeton

Real Talk Princeton is a group of real Princeton students who answer all kinds of questions about Princeton ranging from the social life to “what do I do I was valedictorian at my high school and now I have 3 B’s.”
For nearly half a decade, Real Talk Princeton served prefrosh, confused students, and concerned parents from a blog hosted on Tumblr but earlier this year, its entire archive of 20,000 questions was deleted and the admins were looking for a change.
That’s where we come in. We are building a completely custom platform for Real Talk Princeton with greater security, better regex search, a friendlier user interface, and more powerful tagging. We hope Real Talk Princeton will serve the Princeton community for many years to come.
