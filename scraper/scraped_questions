V3 shitty midterms in a row for Orgo. Any tips for acing the final besides studying my ass off?
p7
aVResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aAll I can suggest is doing all the practice problems you have! I re-did all 6 practice exam 3\u2019s and then did all 6 practice final exams before the finals. I also went back through psets from the second half of the semester. Finals always end up more heavily covering stuff you learned at the end of the semester. I also really found the textbook helpful second semester (I read it religiously), though I was probably in the minority in this respect. If you\u2019re not doing well and haven\u2019t tried the textbook, perhaps try reading it before the final. Good luck bud!!! You can do it, and orgo is almost over forever :)

VEasiest way to go to the ocean with public transportation?
p17
aVResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aTo be entirely honest, I would split a Lyft with friends. Princeton isn\u2019t on the coast, so the train/bus routes that you have to take to get there suck. If you have any friends with a car, that would definitely be a good use for it! If you absolutely needed to use public transportation, I\u2019d take a train towards NY Penn, and then transfer at a stop along the way, for a train toward Long Branch/Bay Head/whatever you need to get to the spot you want.

VWhat's the time commitment for Glee Club like? And how's the audition / is it extremely hard to get in? Thinking about trying out next year.
p22
aVResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aThe audition is not terrible! Pretty sure it\u2019s only ten minutes. You will have to sightread, fair warning, but initially, you do a group exercise, pitch / tone exercises (to test your aural ability), and kind of warmup stuff. It\u2019s a high-caliber group, but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s impossible to get in to. There are extremely experienced singers, but also people who never sang in their high school chorus. Just go for it! :) \u000aRehearsals are MWF for two hours. Also tour next year so audition!

Vfun/special ideas to celebrate someone's birthday around here?
p32
aVResponse from Princess Mia: \u000aOooh this kind of stuff is my favorite! One thing that\u2019s always really fun is to hold a boozy dinner for them with their friends. Some good places for that are Thai Village, EPS Corner, Taste of Mexico, and D\u2019Espana. You could surprise them there with friends and wine! I also think it\u2019s really cute to surprise someone by decorating their room or knocking on their door at exactly midnight or something. Pinot\u2019s Palette is another fun place for birthdays. You could take them out to a nice dinner on Nassau Street or a movie at the Garden Theater. You could take them to get their makeup done at the new MAC store. You could throw them a pregame. You could take them to House of Cupcakes. You could have a group get their nails done. Then options are endless! I guess it depends if you want to do something with a group or one-on-one.

Vsomeone told me that one of the eating clubs is where "your social life goes to die" aka it's for nobodies or something. which one has this reputation and what are some of the reputations of the other eating clubs? thanks in advance
p47
aVResponse from Bateman:\u000aMy best advice is to make your own opinions about the clubs. There\u2019s no point in listing off the stereotypes of each club.. because it\u2019s ridiculous that frosh get to campus knowing which club they want to do (then basing their social life around it)

VWhich eating club has the most engineers? Also, which ones are sign in? Thanks!
p67
aVResponse from Bateman:\u000aCharter is known as the engineering club (it\u2019s close to the street), but you\u2019ll find engineers at every club (esp bc COS is a huge major). Charter, Colonial, Terrace, Clositer, and Quad are sign in.

VHow does one go about "just memorizing" everything in lecture?
p72
aVResponse from Harvey:\u000apeople have different ways of studying/memorizing. I like to look over notes, read lectures/textbook, then consolidate all the important bits/parts i forget into a single study guide, handwritten (writing helps me remember)\u000a\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway: MOL 214 is one of the only classes I\u2019ve taken here where simple memorization was enough to get an A (and PSY classes I\u2019ve taken). I remember by writing my lecture notes over and over again until I know it all by heart. Flashcards could help. Talking through material with others could help.
