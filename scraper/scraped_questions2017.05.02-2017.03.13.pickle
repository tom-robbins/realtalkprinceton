VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aTriangle is definitely selective. It\u2019s much easier if you\u2019re a guy than a girl, because they have a kind of chronic imbalance. Yes, freshmen are always accepted.\u000aResponse from Exupery:\u000aIn terms of theater stuff in general \u2013 some productions or companies (like Triangle) are quite selective, but there are also a lot of productions and companies that have fewer people audition and are thus less selective. If it helps, I had 0 theater experience (besides improv which I started here as a freshman) and randomly started auditioning for stuff this year, and I\u2019m now doing my 4th show (and I\u2019m definitely not like a natural-born star or super talented or anything).

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aAll I can suggest is doing all the practice problems you have! I re-did all 6 practice exam 3\u2019s and then did all 6 practice final exams before the finals. I also went back through psets from the second half of the semester. Finals always end up more heavily covering stuff you learned at the end of the semester. I also really found the textbook helpful second semester (I read it religiously), though I was probably in the minority in this respect. If you\u2019re not doing well and haven\u2019t tried the textbook, perhaps try reading it before the final. Good luck bud!!! You can do it, and orgo is almost over forever :)

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aTo be entirely honest, I would split a Lyft with friends. Princeton isn\u2019t on the coast, so the train/bus routes that you have to take to get there suck. If you have any friends with a car, that would definitely be a good use for it! If you absolutely needed to use public transportation, I\u2019d take a train towards NY Penn, and then transfer at a stop along the way, for a train toward Long Branch/Bay Head/whatever you need to get to the spot you want.

It\u2019s a high-caliber group, but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s impossible to get in to. There are extremely experienced singers, but also people who never sang in their high school chorus.

VResponse from Princess Mia: \u000aOooh this kind of stuff is my favorite! One thing that\u2019s always really fun is to hold a boozy dinner for them with their friends. Some good places for that are Thai Village, EPS Corner, Taste of Mexico, and D\u2019Espana. You could surprise them there with friends and wine! I also think it\u2019s really cute to surprise someone by decorating their room or knocking on their door at exactly midnight or something. Pinot\u2019s Palette is another fun place for birthdays. You could take them out to a nice dinner on Nassau Street or a movie at the Garden Theater. You could take them to get their makeup done at the new MAC store. You could throw them a pregame. You could take them to House of Cupcakes. You could have a group get their nails done. Then options are endless! I guess it depends if you want to do something with a group or one-on-one.

If you\u2019re in at least one (you could be inactive and therefore in none) then it\u2019s a min commitment of 5 hrs/week\u201d

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI think PHY 108 is just like any other class here \u2013 some people are struggling a lot more than others. It might be slightly easier for some people who took PHY 101 (they apparently went over some of the same concepts). I personally didn\u2019t take 101 here, and PHY 108 has come surprisingly easy to me (I thought I\u2019d be struggling to keep an A but that hasn\u2019t been the case). It\u2019s very possible to do well if you keep up with the material. At pset help sessions, it seems like some people have more difficulty with the psets than others. I think the average talent level is relatively high? Average on the last exam was an 83 I think, other exams were just under 80 for averages.

That\u2019s a ridiculously relevant field \u2013 even if you just plan to go straight to SW development \u2013 and it\u2019d be great to go into the industry understanding some of it. I definitely wish I knew more; I\u2019ve started to study it on my own, but it\u2019d be nice to have done that in the context of a class.\u000aEDIT: I just remembered that when I was on the interview circuit for full-time product management roles, I asked everyone what I could do in my last year to prep for my full-time job. I don\u2019t think there was a single interviewer who didn\u2019t mention statistics and/or data science.\u000aResponse from Sparverius:\u000aI don\u2019t disagree with any of that, but I\u2019ll just say that if you want to actually learn data science and/or R you\u2019re better off just working through a textbook than taking 201 as long as the professor is the same (because that\u2019s what you\u2019ll end up doing anyway). But it\u2019s not a bad idea as a 5th class because there are no exams and you can pretty much learn the statistics material as you go through the psets/projects\u2014they hold your hand through a lot of it. Just be prepared for slow mind-numbing lectures.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech::\u000aThis is a serious question right? In the future, I\u2019m not going to answer questions that don\u2019t help students with their lives at Princeton in general fyi. So I suggest that people consider that when submitting questions.\u000aBut anyway, I\u2019m not amazing at proselytizing if you\u2019re trying to recruit me for some activity. I did do volunteer work with my church in Jamaica though where we helped build houses, wells, and of course spread the teachings of Jesus. I think my conversion rate was only slightly higher than that of the average Mormon. I also volunteered at a Psychiatric Center and taught out-patients how to play music, much of it was Christian related. Though, while I try to follow the teachings of Christ, I\u2019m obviously human and not perfect. For example, I hadn\u2019t been going to church that much last semester due to a variety of issues. On campus, there are people who are simply better than me in keeping up with their Christianity.\u000aIf you\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s going to scream on the streets and threaten people constantly with hellfire, I\u2019m not you\u2019re guy. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to inspire genuine faith, not in the normative behavior of Jesus, and most importantly counterproductive to our goal of helping to create more disciples. It makes me sad to hear atheists validly state that they are ironically being treated in a non-Christian way by Christians.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000ayeah, for sure. I think sometimes time to yourself helps. It\u2019s totally okay to not want to hang out with people sometimes. I do some mix of the following when I feel like absolute shit: take a long, warm shower, take a nap (when it\u2019s nice out, outside), go for a walk, eat some chocolate, write in a journal, drink some coke, and ignore literally everything else.\u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000ayes quite frequently, there\u2019s usually not an exact cause to pinpoint, often it\u2019s just like a mixture of like friends being annoying, schoolwork, general people being annoying, the weather, rtp haters, and other things (jk about the last one). But yeah, like Winnie, I find time to myself to be the best option cuz I just don\u2019t want to be around others. I try not to take a nap cuz I feel like I\u2019ll never get out of bed. I\u2019ll go to the gym and also this semester I really enjoy playing basketball in Dillon with others (that\u2019s a time when interacting with others is ok). It\u2019s also nice cuz I have a couple friends who I feel like I can always talk to about things\u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aI agree with Pichu and Winnie here - and it\u2019s totally normal to feel down. There are just some things that make you not want to smile and that\u2019s unfortunate but it\u2019s okay. There are people around you who may not necessarily understand and, in my experience, these kinds of feelings can be compounded by the fact that life/work has to go on (lol). For me, what works is music. Listening to some good music is fantastic - sometimes, old-school jazz does the trick - and you\u2019ll rarely see me walk around campus without headphones. Also, hanging out with different groups of people is really nice because it\u2019s always great to catch up with someone who I haven\u2019t spoken with in a while. \u000aOH! And watching videos - funny ones or \u201cempowering\u201d ones (also lol) - is super good. Currently watching a Taraji compilation video and it\u2019s great\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aLast semester, I was feeling terrible and was struggling real hard. Both my grandparents had died in a short period of time, one of my friends on campus committed suicide, another one of my friends was assaulted, and my ex broke up with me and hit me over the head with a beer bottle. I was exhausted from having to travel between LA and London to recover funds from my Grandparents\u2019 estates and was having terrible insomnia no matter what I did. I was so down because it felt like I was just inept and furthermore, no one cared. It\u2019s not like during internship interviews they factored any of these things in and none of my professors would grant extensions for anything. Everything was just crashing down on me with no help.\u000aNeedless to say, I\u2019m trying to tell you guys that just because people look fine and happy on the outside, there may be factors that they are internalizing. I had to keep it together to finish classes and also for interviews. Fortunately, at the end of the day, everything worked out and I still got a position for this summer and succeeded academically. I owe it to having some close friends for support who I eventually reached out to and discussed my troubles. My best friend and cousin from UPenn was the most help and during Christmas break I really was able to recuperate for finals. He tried anything to help no matter how small like going on a drive to Niagara falls. It was the small things like this that everyone did to help me that added up and helped me power through.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aThis is really a vague question, so idrk if this is the type of answer you\u2019re going for, but I\u2019ve learned a lot of German philosophy that really made me think. Specific thinkers that kinda blew me away were Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Schmitt, Adorno and Arendt (all in different ways, obviously). I also read Rousseau for the first time in a different class and it was a fantastic experience. I\u2019m writing my final paper for one class on the way Saint-Just read the enlightenment, and I\u2019ve been learning a ton of interesting stuff about the French Revolution and Revolutionary thought from my current research.\u000aI also am taking a class on Christian art, and one book in particular I read (\u201dClash of the Gods\u201d by Thomas Matthews) left a real impression. My intellectual admiration for different trends in Christian thought has skyrocketed because of this class (and I gained an aesthetic appreciation for things that I couldn\u2019t understand enough to enjoy before).\u000aAlso my Russian is finally good enough to watch Russian tv casually, and I fucking loved the TV shows Kitchen and Hotel Eleon (I feel like this counts as something I \u201clearned\u201d). \u000aIf this year includes last semester, my class on US foreign relations taught me a ton of interesting stuff that has helped me better understand the current and historical worlds. Also my French class that semester first opened me up to classical French literature, which has made both this and last semester a blast (favorite poet of all time is Rimbaud, what a qt).

VSeconding PHI203 as a good intro class: 2 of the papers are incredibly short, to the point where I wouldn't even really describe them as papers, and the standards (at least from my preceptor) are pretty chill. The papers really cared more about just whether you could be thoughtful about the readings and ideas rather than any sort of formal philosophical paper structure or anything

I had another friend who did get in, but he had won some insane MUN award in high school and was like the best person in NY. \u000aI\u2019m pretty sure that anyone can join Whig-Clio? I\u2019m not in the group, but am extra about politics, and have gone to a ton of their events, including almost every watch party and a lot of the debates/talks. Their promotional posters also said \u201call are welcome\u201d at the beginning of the year. \u000aI think Mock Trial is less selective than MUN. You can read more about their try-outs here: http://princetonmocktrial.com/tryouts.html\u000aIf anybody has any more info, please feel free to let us know, as I\u2019m just going off of friends\u2019 experiences!

I see them all the time in my room or when I go over to her room on my way out of the building or something. When I haven\u2019t seen them in a couple days I\u2019ll ask to study with em or make sure I stop by to catch up and ask how things are going. A few other of my closest friends are MOL majors, so we share classes, do psets together, sit together in classes, fail to pay attention for entire lectures (lol have been laughing entirely too much in cell dev the last few classes). I\u2019m very busy, but I don\u2019t feel like my friendships are particularly hurt by it. Everyone is busy at Princeton (perhaps I\u2019m a little more busy than average, but I like it that way).

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aSince about 70% of princeton premeds take a gap year, most take their mcat the summer before senior year. Some may take it the summer before junior year (but many of us haven\u2019t finished biochem and physics by then). So the people that are applying without taking a gap year (like me) end up taking it at the end of junior year. The med school app opens tomorrow (lol kill me), and you can submit starting june 1st I believe. Med schools won\u2019t look at your app till your mcat score is in (takes 30 days post test day for the scores to be released), so you need to take it at least a month before youre planning to submit, otherwise it will stall your app. Also, HPA generally won\u2019t write your committee letter until your mcat is in.

But also if you want to be in less pieces it\u2019s less time-consuming. Definitely not a light commitment if you intend to be active in the group, I don\u2019t think.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aLol I remember last time I got a question like this I wrote a really in-depth description of what I do every day. RIP the old blog.\u000aEvery day is kinda different tbh. Today I\u2019ve been in the library/studying all day. I\u2019m tryna write my entire JP before the day ends (and do a physics pset). Tomorrow I\u2019m going to the gym in the am, then have class/work from 10-4:30, then have to go to lab, then I\u2019m going on a date (lol), then I have a meeting and may go out if I finish everything I need to today. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are super busy for me with classes. Tuesdays/Fridays and weekends I do pretty much all of my work. I go to the gym for like 1.5 hours every day (would prefer to go twice a day but my schedule has not permitted that this semester). I usually prefer studying alone, but sometimes I will study with other humans. I usually go out to dinner once a week with my close friends. Now that I\u2019m 21 I\u2019ve been going to bars semi-frequently on weekends (Dirty Shirley\u2019s). Idk I\u2019m busy with lab, EMT, work, skewl, and drinking but keeping busy keeps me happy and sane. Also, I watch too much Netflix (not TOO MUCH but like slightly too much). Everyone should watch this netflix original called the 3% (so good omg). Sorry this is more of a synopsis of what I spend my time doing than an actual schedule.

That being said, I\u2019m sure most people would feel the way you do. Just make sure to diversify your own friendships, and maybe see if you might like hanging with these new people too?

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aThe two paths described are very similar, but still slightly different. ORFE is basically applied math and is on the engineering track. You would have to take more courses (36 vs. 31 to be exact) in addition to certain BSE requirements like chemistry. However, you would be exempt from certain AB requirements such as a language.\u000aOther than those preferences, I would also add that the ECO major has a lot more theory than ORFE (at least in my experience) and is slightly less quantitatively based. ORFE classes also use a lot more computer programming and modeling than ECO in general such as Python. But one nice thing about the ECO major is that most of its requirements fit right into the finance certificate if you want it.\u000aLastly, you do have to choose between BSE or AB before freshman year, but you can switch at anytime up to a certain point, provided that you can still fulfill the necessary requirements.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aWell, obviously different majors will require different classes. A CBE major will take a very different set of courses than a SOC major. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but it\u2019s just a fact. Each major has its own set of prereqs, which will also cause discrepancies in difficulty. Additionally, BSE majors are required to take a certain set of classes their freshman year (physics, chem, math, cos, writing sem), whereas AB majors can take anything. Also, BSE majors have to take 36 classes (vs. AB 31), which can make a big difference, because BSE students end up in 5 classes fairly often. If people are premed/pre-dentistry, that can make a difference in course load. I also think that people are just interested in different things. If somebody wants to take 5 tough classes, then power to them. \u000aResponse from Amygdala:\u000aI also think there\u2019s just some difference in the inherent difficulty of the subject material. It is undeniably easier for a large majority of people to grasp key concepts in psychology and sociology than it is in physics/advanced mathematics/various other theoretical and quantitative subjects just because in the former fields, we have the benefit of more intuitive understanding and less abstraction is required to understand the material. This isn\u2019t a value judgement that the latter are better or more worthy, just a fact that often contributes to the difficulty of a course or major.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000anone of us are grad students so I\u2019m posting for responses. Also gonna write about some things I\u2019ve noticed.\u000aI know a few different kinds of grad student relationships:\u000a1) Married\u000aI have known/know three different pairs of married graduate students. Clearly they have time for this. Two of the three had children already. All married before graduate school began.\u000a2) Dating another grad student\u000aI think this is fairly common? I know multiple grad student pairs dating other princeton grad students, and a few dating non-Princeton grad students. I\u2019d assume they met through shared interests, though not all were in the same department, but normally similar departments.\u000a3) Dating an undergrad\u000aKnow of two pairs like this. Grad student is fairly young, like you, and in both couples he\u2019s a guy and undergrad is a girl. One pair met through a summer thing together, another through precept. Think the first way to meet is a little less creepy, but to each their own. There are some graduate students that are in student clubs (aka in an eating club, or in a dance club or sports club are the only examples I have off the top of my head of graduate students I know) which probably helps here.\u000aI also knew one grad student that was just dating a guy who lived in Princeton, and then when she graduated he moved with her. They had met in undergrad though, and he had moved to Princeton with her, and I really think they\u2019ll be married soon. This is clearly fairly atypical of my interactions with grad students.\u000aSo clearly it\u2019s possible. That said, I feel like a lot of the grad students I know/have interacted with seem fairly isolated and kind of lacking in social interaction. It\u2019s sad, but I can see how you fall into that way of life pretty easily. You definitely have to make a real effort and put time into it.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000adefinitely not true! However, might be true right now. It\u2019s going to be a really stressful next few weeks for most people, so I feel like now is not the best time to be seeking deep friendships. That said, now\u2019s a great time to set seeds for better friendships for next year. I\u2019m sure you have a bunch of acquaintances you\u2019re on decent terms with. Invite them to a meal and to study throughout the next couple weeks (but don\u2019t be surprised/offended/think it means anything negative if some tell you they\u2019re busy and dying \u2013 if you text me this is what will probably happen l o l). Then when next year starts you can catch up again. Next year is a new start \u2013 i\u2019d recommend joining a few new ECs. Non-academic ECs tend to be much closer than academic ones. If you\u2019re not in an eating club, consider signing in somewhere. Most sophs that joined this semester still don\u2019t really know anything near the whole club, and I\u2019m sure they all want to make new friends in their new clubs, so they are a great opportunity. If you\u2019re independent, you can try meeting the people on your hall and seeing if they want to share cooking with you. I feel like food (clubs, cooking, whatever) is always a good way to make okay friendships that grow the more time you spend together (you can always invite them to study after :) ). \u000aI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone that doesn\u2019t want to make friends, just some people fall into complacency.\u000aEdit: I just realized you\u2019re probably a frosh going INTO sophomore year, rather than a current soph. What I said about people being busy right now and joining new ECs is definitely still true. Same with joining a club in the spring. I just want to reassure you \u2013 I completely changed most of my friends between frosh and soph year and I am way happier for it, and it wasn\u2019t weird at all! I was acquainted with all the people I\u2019d consider my closest friends now, but though I was good friends with a few, I really only got close to most this year. \u000aalso, I\u2019ve only had positive experiences with people I met through rtp before. so If you feel like we\u2019d get along and you ever want to grab a meal, you can feel free to send your netid ;)) if you think that\u2019s awks af no pressure tho

It will be something unusual that you probably won\u2019t do again, unless you go hiking a lot or something, but even then it\u2019ll still be a new experience because of the people. In contrast, I think you could get the CA experience other ways, like through breakout or just normal volunteering. Would def rec trying OA.

It\u2019s very very good for people who are interested and love math, but aren\u2019t fully attracted to or able to do tons of theory. It\u2019s a very different engineering major compared to the others and involves a lot less of labs. It\u2019s also filled with finance people as basically almost everyone in the major goes on into very successful Wallstreet careers. Less go on directly to grad school. I can\u2019t really speak for MIT as I don\u2019t know anybody there, but I hope that this can help you make a comparison. Furthermore, at the end of the day, I\u2019d just also like to reiterate that no matter which college you choose, they are both wonderful options. You can\u2019t go wrong with either.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aNo problem. The answer to your question is one again a mix. For sure, the Christian community as a whole at Princeton is more socially conservative with regards to dress, partying, drinking, etc. in general. Some students prefer being involved in Christian groups to get away from the partying scene. However, we have a huge mix of people from athletes to self described comic book geeks and plenty of students are not ultra socially conservative, especially in the way that you described.  \u000aBut let\u2019s just use me as an example to make things easier. My fashion is all over the place from three piece suits to tshirts and jeans. I go to parties and I\u2019m a DJ who loves and specializes in Euro House. And I strongly desire to date here on campus (not saying it\u2019s worked so far though). So by my calculations, I don\u2019t fit that definition of social conservatism very much.\u000aHope that helps.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aHere at Princeton, we have a large and passionate Christian community. Some of our many clubs and groups include Princeton Evangelical Fellowship (PEF, which I am member of), Princeton Faith and Action, and MANA. All of these groups are similar yet slightly different in what they do such as encounter, bible study, etc. Therefore, you can pick ones that match your interests the best.It\u2019s also not hard at all to get involved with these groups so it is very easy to meet other Christians.\u000aAs for your question regarding conservatism in the Christian community, I would argue that there is a high degree of political diversity within the Christian groups. We have several people who are very big Bernie fans and see social justice as translating their faith into meaningful impact. I personally know several people who are liberal and very Christian. That being said, most of the conservatives here on campus are Christian so they do have higher representation in the groups. So I always say this as a general rule, most of conservatives on campus are Christian, but most of the Christians are not conservative.

VErrr a bit awk but I'm from California. I swim and like a lot of guys here I shave my armpit + arm + chest + leg hair for meets and stuff. I want to swim at Princeton, too (club swimming and stuff), so I have a couple of questions. So uh #1: Are there good opportunities for swimming club and stuff here? And #2: Is there any place on/near campus where a guy can get his legs + chest + arm waxed or shaved without judgement? Like this is legit a thing for male swimmers and I don't need haters lolz

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI didn\u2019t drink much in high school because I was just so focused on work. Like, all the time. When I came to college, I kind of had the mentality that getting into Princeton was enough; as long as I got reasonably fine grades, I was gonna be more than okay once I graduated. That more balanced mentality leaves plenty of time for drinkin, and I think it\u2019s a pretty healthy way to approach college. Just, like, exercise moderation in all things, jafeel? \u000aLogistically, you just have to put yourself out there, make some friends to pregame with, and start going out to the clubs. Princeton\u2019s social system isn\u2019t perfect, but it definitely makes it easy to have fun, at least. I would also add that joining a club helped me, since TI does have a solid drinking culture.

I\u2019d also always been so much more passionate about humanities-related things and came to terms with the fact that that arena was where I was better suited. I actually applied as an AB student, and switched to BSE the summer before my freshman year. It\u2019s been three semesters since my switch and I\u2019ve been in a much better place and no longer feel like I\u2019m drowning. I also joined BSE for all the wrong reasons, although I am sort of thankful that I started out the way that I did because I ended up meeting some people who are some of my good friends today that I probably wouldn\u2019t have met otherwise.

VResponse from Pichu:\u000a(i\u2019m a math major btw) i understand your dilemma very much, looking back I felt similarly to you (and probably still do now). Not sure if you\u2019re a prefrosh or a freshman tho. Have you tried math/physics major courses (like MAT 215/217, PHY 105/106)? I know the idea of majoring in math/physics is scary but it\u2019s worth a try, it gets you thinking in a new way about subjects that you already like.\u000aIf you do switch to BSE, yeah most of the BSE majors do become pretty specialized when you get to higher levels. My friends who are like MAE, CBE, CEE, and ELE all take like really specific courses now that I could never see myself taking (except maybe MAE, that seems kinda cool). But if you like math and mathematical stuff, ORFE and COS are like less hardcore engineery and could be potential fits (unless you don\u2019t really like programming, then maybe not COS).\u000aDespite its name ORFE is basically applied math/statistics. You don\u2019t have to be in like a lab for like hours per day like other engineering majors and it\u2019s the most math-y like BSE major I feel. And although like almost all ORFE majors are finance fucks who don\u2019t know anything and think getting a job on Wall Street is the solution to life, if you can get past being around those people, ORFE is a pretty good major for someone who likes math, quantitative / analytical thinking, but thinks theoretical math is too out of this world for them.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aNot Amygdala, but I took the course last fall and thought it was a very easy, manageable and enriching course. You have mild readings each week along with a response paper. Then you have two small quizes that are essentially free points and two take home exams that are not that stressful (midterm and final).\u000aIt really is the best possible introductory overview of Islam and starts with the history of Muhammad all the way up to ISIS. Just be advised, that if you primarily care only about modern issues in Muslim countries like some WWS concentrators did, then you will be disappointed that this content is only about 15%-20% of the course. However, I would argue that a lot of the earlier content is imperative to understanding what is modern such as the Shia and Sunnî split. \u000aProfessor Zaman is also great. But what makes his lectures so incredible is not just his immense knowledge of Islam (both the medieval and the modern), but rather his ability to convey his thoughts so effortlessly to a western audience using devices such as analogies that only Americans would understand. It really makes learning about the religion much much easier and gave the students a deeper grasp on the material. I also enjoy that he was not pushing any sort of an agenda. He simply provided the mainstream scholarly opinions on several Islamic issues and tried to describe the facets of the religion as best as possible. People walked away from the course feeling more positive and Islam, and some walked away feeling more negative. So overall, I strongly recommend the course either PDFing or for a grade. It\u2019s probably one of the best EM\u2019s out there.

VResponse from Pichu:\u000ain almost all cases, there\u2019s nothing stopping you from enrolling in a course if you haven\u2019t taken the prereqs specified on the registrar. they\u2019re only there as a guideline to ensure you\u2019re at some level of smartness required for the course, but even if you haven\u2019t taken the prereqs most of the time you\u2019ll be able to learn the required material on your own as you take the course. so there\u2019s usually no need to talk your way into a course

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aYou are right, there isn\u2019t enough support for most of these issues (well at least direct aid). And I think this does contribute to a major problem because a little less than 1/3rd of Princeton students at any time feel somewhat \u201coverwhelmed\u201d either academically, socially, etc. At times, unfortunately, the Princeton environment has not been very acclimating to some of my friends and resulted in negative consequences.\u000aThat being said, I think that changing one\u2019s mindset and adjusting attitudes can help. I\u2019m one of those people who has faced endless competitive rejections, but at the end of the day, I eventually got into 1 or 2 positions I was considering. I also found that I could have a much more fun time in less competitive clubs/activities. Things like performance groups and eating clubs don\u2019t define your value as a person. The mechanisms for selecting people are often imperfect anyway.\u000aLastly, we still have some resources and certain staff members on campus would be happy to help you. Your RCA can be a good resource and they have the empathy to understand your situations better generally. Each residential college also has a director of student life whose sole purpose is to help you in any non-academic areas of your life. I would also not describe CPS as \u201clame\u201d Yes, there are major problems with it and I would be lying if I stated that they don\u2019t do a mediocre job for some students. However, a lot of students really benefit from their services as well.\u000a\u000a\u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000a\u000aI would also like to add that these are problems at literally every single college, not just Princeton. And yes, like Maybach said, there are other people you can reach out to. I have talked to my RCAs about my life problems many many times (that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for) and have seen my DSL a few times as well. There ARE other resources there for you.

I can tell you that for some, academics is of no concern at all, but struggles come from other areas on the campus: friends, eating club concerns, emotional stress, dealing w the endless competitive rejections (yes, even A students here face those A LOT) & there\u2019s woefully no support for this stuff outside the lame CPS. So, rtp, in case I overlooked, where\u2019s the support for these issues?

VResponse from Sparverius:\u000aEEB is generally considered easier, and you have a much wider range of classes you can take since tons of things count as departmentals (including a bunch of policy classes and stuff from other random departments). Thesis topics can vary a lot; everything from ecology/animal biology to disease dynamics or molecular evolution. MOL is pretty rigid with the four required core classes, and your thesis is generally based on lab work (though you can also do a more quantitative thesis or non-lab literature review of a topic). Other than that your choice should be based on what interests you the most. \u000aIn terms of careers, you can be pre-med easily with either, and I don\u2019t think it would make much of a difference for other fields. It matters more if you want to go to grad school / do research.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI think you\u2019re talking about course advisors. (In case you\u2019re talking about IW, you pick both your advisor and your second reader, assuming those people want work with you, too.) W/r/t courses, there are just a few advisors for the entire department. They meet with all of their people for 10-minute slots to check off courses each semester (i.e., make sure students are going to actually get their 2-2-2-2 done). So, for example, my last name puts me with Sandra Batista, so she\u2019s the person who signs off on my form every semester \u2013 as well as the forms of probably dozens of other students. She\u2019s also there to give me advice depending on my interests/background, if needed (she helped me figure out the right theory class to take, for instance \u2013 had a lil pre-340 panic).

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aRegardless of AB or BSE, it\u2019s not a bad idea to take courses in a variety of COS disciplines so that you can start to develop a sense of what you might like. So, like, introductory systems (206), introductory theory (340), a basic applications course (e.g., 435), etc. wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. Could be good to take 333 before you do your first IW project, though it\u2019s probably also an advantage to have done IW before you take 333, so it\u2019s a tossup there.

COS 424 is mostly just implementing sci-kit learn packages in Python and you won\u2019t get much theory out of it. 402 had more theory, and you can probably expect that in 324 as well, but 324 is likely going to be easier (it\u2019s new though so impossible to say).

Other than that, though, I hand em out on a first come first served basis \u2013 and I know that my friends in the club do the same. So it\u2019s possible that you were amongst a group of members. It\u2019s also possible that there was a really shitty person behind the bar. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m sorry we let a person like that in, and I\u2019m more sorry they treated you like that.

VResponse from Olivia Pope:\u000aI think if there was some change in your financial situation or perhaps some part of your situation that they didn\u2019t take into as great a consideration as they should have then it\u2019s probably be grounds for reconsideration. I\u2019m not sure if just sending another school\u2019s package would make then change their opinion. I think it\u2019s probably worth another shot.

Vi reached out to the financial aid office for a reevaluation of my aid because it was expensive, but they didn't change it. the amount i have to pay for princeton is significantly higher than other private and public universities i've gotten accepted into (i sent another school's package too). is there any way to appeal again? if they said no once, will it always be no?

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aI heard Farber is not bad, and that he\u2019s a little more math-y than most professors who teach ECO 100 (but the math still isn\u2019t too hard, it\u2019s just ECO 100). Don\u2019t know exactly what his lectures are like, but my friends who had him didn\u2019t seem to complain much. I had Rosen and I thought his lectures were quite good and I enjoyed going. If you\u2019re just interested in taking Econ for fun and you\u2019re not in a rush to take it, I would wait for Harvey Rosen cuz he just seems to care a lot and put a lot of effort into the class. Having said that, if you want to gain a better understanding for econ, macro is for sure better. It\u2019s better than micro in helping you understand how the world works and understanding what you hear on TV if you watch news relating to the economy, the markets, etc.

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aHonestly, it depends a lot on what you want to get out of school. Princeton is an intense bubble. If you come here, your life will be Princeton for four years. Many people never really leave campus (although some of us do, I try to get out every weekend). It is hard but there are a ton of resources and a lot of people who can help you. I also think it would be easier to find your niche at Princeton, where everyone is really invested in extracurriculars and there are only 5,000 students than at a state school with 25k+ students. Here, you can make personal relationships with faculty if you seek that out; at a state school, you\u2019ll probably just be a number. Princeton is hard work but if you don\u2019t care that much about your GPA it becomes a lot less hard. It\u2019s not too difficult to get a 3.0 here. It\u2019s the people who really want a 3.7+ that find academics really consuming. \u000aI think being here has been rewarding in that I have learned a ton about myself and have had a lot of research and travel opportunities that I am not sure I would have been able to have at a state school. I have also been surrounded by (generally) intelligent people (although honestly I thought people here would be a lot smarter and more mature when I was a prefrosh). It has also been stressful and kind of weirdly exclusive, but I think that might be the case at a lot of places, even state schools. \u000aAnyway, my verdict is: don\u2019t be worried about fitting in, there are so many different groups and environments on campus and one is sure to work out for you. If Princeton is a financial burden for your family, talk to the financial aid office, especially if you got a scholarship at your state school. They might be able to match it. My thought on difficulty is that you come to college to learn and grow and you\u2019re going to do that best in a challenging environment. Coasting for four years sounds really boring to me. I guess my last thought is that there are hundreds of students on Princeton\u2019s waitlist who are really eager for a challenging and rigorous place. If you\u2019re really not feeling that at all, then don\u2019t force yourself into a miserable four years; take your state school\u2019s offer and let them have your spot here.

Like, in a not-a-chance-in-hell-because-I\u2019m-destined-to-study-history kind of way. So, being the future history major that I was, I didn\u2019t take the AP physics exam at the end of that class. Flash forward  a year, I\u2019m an incoming COS major who has the chem and bio AP credits, no goddamned physics credit, and a total lack of desire to go through Princeton\u2019s introductory physics classes. If I\u2019d just taken that exam, it would\u2019ve afforded me so much flexibilitiy when deciding between COS BSE and AB\u2026 Like, 3-hour exam vs. 1-year thesis. Not saying I still wouldn\u2019t have gone the route of AB, but that flexibility would\u2019ve been really nice. Be absolutely, 200% positive that there\u2019s no chance you\u2019ll want to consider BSE.\u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000ayou need to take both AP-C mechanics and E&M to place out of BSE physics reqs, btw (and get 5 on both)\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aWoops sorry *2* 3-hour exams vs. a 1-year thesis

I guess that the entrepreneurship certificate might help show interest, but that\u2019s about it. Economics and Finance courses here are still very different from management courses. Most people work for a few years before getting their MBA anyways. I would just choose a major you enjoy because GPA and GMAT scores are more important than major if you are coming from Princeton.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aHey, sure I can talk about why I\u2019m not a huge fan of the class. First of all, it\u2019s a new prof this year. I\u2019ve talked to people who took it last year/the year before, and they loved the class. The new prof is pretty disorganized and has a guest lecturer come in to lecture on their research/specialty pretty much every class. I think it\u2019s great to have guest lecturers like that, but there are literally no over-arching themes in the course. It\u2019s literally a week of smoking, a week of obesity, a week of stress, a class on weed, a class on diet, a class on ADHD, a class on vaccines\u2026 Nothing is interconnected. It\u2019s just one topic after another, and once we\u2019re done with one topic, that\u2019s it. I just find the course to be very disorganized and not well put together. \u000aI also found the midterm to be absurd. She expected us to memorize the most random facts that I\u2019ve ever had to memorize on an exam at Princeton. Like we had to memorize the number of people that smoke in America? It was incredibly surface-level, and I find that the entire course is that way. \u000aIt\u2019s a super interesting field, I agree with you completely. The prof just isn\u2019t doing it justice this semester. The papers we read are super cool but the course as a whole is eh.\u000a\u000aIf any readers are in the class and have a different opinion please send it in; happy to post.

You could say something like \u201coh, I\u2019m not really sure yet\u201d or \u201chm probably some HIS class\u201d or something. You could also only tell them specifically classes that you know they can\u2019t take- for example, something application-only, something that they haven\u2019t taken the prereqs for, or something that they have a class that they can\u2019t move at the same time.

For upperclassmen who are independent, they usually make the argument that they need their car to buy groceries. Other reasons could be you need it for some extracurricular activities like club sports or other clubs where you need someone with a car to go do things for their club. Also, could talk about needing to go home to visit family because of some reason.\u000ai\u2019m a junior, i know a couple juniors who got a permit through this process, and know of one sophomore, but not any freshman. i know how you feel about the cars, i like having it on campus even tho i use it like just once a week, but idk how likely it is you\u2019ll be able to get a permit as a freshman. just email them and try to come up with some compelling reason of why you want a permit other than just \u201ci like driving\u201d

It\u2019s a new course, so I can\u2019t really review it for you, but Professor Wright was the assistant prof of core lab when I took it this fall, and she was pretty good. At least read the course description and see if the course is something you\u2019d be interested in. Biotech with Flint is also an option (MOL 433). I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s not that hard. That\u2019s about it for MOL departmentals other than biochem and core lab next semester. I think it\u2019s just an off year or something (because they\u2019re not offering MOL 340).\u000aYou could take an EEB class. 300 and 400 level EEB classes count as MOL departmentals.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aThere are tons that you can take without orgo. Cellular neurobiology, cellular immunology, viruses, cell dev, genetics. Pretty sure molecular basis of cancer wouldn\u2019t require orgo. Neither would biotech. Sorry these are not organized by semester I didn\u2019t realize you asked specifically for spring. I\u2019d go with genetics or cell dev. Either is fine. \u000aI took genetics sophomore spring (with NEU 202, CHM304b, and POL220). It was a chill semester that became hellish because I was spending >12 hours per week in EMT class.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aTbh, I chose it on a whim. It sort of interested me, I found it challenging, and I thought it\u2019d be nice to get out of my comfort zone. But, I stuck with it because of the opportunities it affords you after graduation \u2013 and I\u2019m so so glad that I did. The tech industry is so exciting, and product management is genuinely my dream job. (If you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019m starting work, like, 10 days after graduation because I <3 LinkedIn and can\u2019t wait to go back.) \u000aIn terms of good things: I\u2019ve really enjoyed all of my IW projects. (A huge benefit of AB COS, btw). They\u2019ve helped me find my niche, and they\u2019ve allowed me to practice some critical product management skills. (For all you COS majors complaining that our department is \u201ctoo theoretical,\u201d idk why you don\u2019t just fix your own problem and do a thesis or another IW project\u2026) I also really like the faculty. They literally give us so much attention in all of those crazy office hours, in our IW seminars, etc. And from talking to my friends in other departments, I feel like I\u2019ve really lucked out with my advisor. There\u2019s also a nice COS community. Even though it\u2019s the biggest department at the school, you can find niche groups \u2014 PWiCS, ACM, the senior thesis thing \u2014 within it, and that\u2019s nice. And finally, while this is a little obvious, it\u2019s hard to beat the job prospects\u2026 how many other departments can you name that have those kinds of opportunities while not needing to care much about stressful stuff like GPAs or test scores?\u000a In terms of less good things things: I don\u2019t love that we\u2019re forced to take 2 systems, 2 theory, 2 apps, etc. It\u2019d be nice if we had a little more flexibility. I think it\u2019d be great if the department also offered more introductory classes for people who want to learn more about computer science without necessarily becoming COS majors or committing to something like 126. (I.e., democratizing CS = a good thing) Mmm and I guess it\u2019s a lot of work? :P

We only have six in the inbox and none of them are on touchy subjects, most are just directed at specific contributors so they\u2019re waiting for those contributors to answer. We also never delete questions (the only thing we delete is troll comments and comments that just say \u201cthanks\u201d).

My advisor was awful and would not answer my emails and had no spots on WASS. I got an email from my res college director of studies the night before course selection saying that I wouldn\u2019t be able to register for courses the next day. Of course, I live for that shit (literally course selection is like Christmas to me), so I was freaking out. Luckily, my director of studies is wonderful, and dealt with me sprinting to his office at 6 pm. If you can\u2019t get your advisor\u2019s signature, at least try to meet with a representative from your department or even your res college director of studies ASAP so you can get a signature.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI chose to pursue two certificates for a few reasons. 1. I think it will look somewhat better on a resume and I want to demonstrate additional interest in another subject completely different from my major, 2. There really isn\u2019t that much extra work to do them, 3. I like pursuing a wide variety of intellectual interests.\u000a\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway: I don\u2019t really think having certificates looks that great on a resume tbh. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good reason to pursue them at all. I\u2019m getting a neuro certificate (I\u2019m a MOL major). It\u2019s only 2 neuro prerequisite classes and 4 departmentals. 2 of those departmentals count as MOL departmentals, and a third is my EM (neuroethics). Cellular neurobiology was actually my favorite class at Princeton. I\u2019m super interested in the neuro field and almost went for the neuro major. I just decided that MOL had more departmentals that I was interested in. \u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aLike Maybach, I\u2019m also getting two certificates. One is in something that I\u2019ve always been super interested in and passionate about, but didn\u2019t get to study extensively through my major, so I decided to get the certificate so I could take more classes and do independent work with the department. The other is actually a random thing that I was totally inspired to get because of one class that I took on a whim, and am actually super happy with that decision. I also think the second thing is pretty different from my major (the first is more related), so I liked having a separate program to learn from and later use for jobs/grad school/etc.\u000aResponse from Olivia Pope:\u000aJust wanted to add the perspective of someone who is not pursuing any certificates. Part of the reason that I am not pursuing one is because of timing. After switching from engineering my soph spring, I didn\u2019t think that I\u2019d have that much space in my schedule to pursue one. I might have either gotten the AFS or AAS certificates, given that I just happened to take some of the required classes,but I realized that I don\u2019t plan on doing a thesis related to either field and would have to take some classes that I didn\u2019t want to take to fulfill the requirements. Also to reiterate the point that Nick Carraway made, I also do not think that having certificates really impacts how employers/others look at your resume. Not having any hasn\u2019t had any impact in terms of getting internships and what not.

If that happens, we usually post it saying \u201cdoes anyone else know about this.\u201d In fact if anything, we even post somewhat obscene questions like this weird one related to masturbation a while ago.\u000aI know for a fact that I\u2019ve already taken the risk to answer some sensitive questions with a few occasions of controversial backlashes. I really rarely see questions deleted unless they are obviously offensive and/or too personal and revealing (e.j. which eating club are you in?). Personally, I\u2019ve answered plenty of questions with dark tones or depressing topics such as anxiety issues, lack of social connections, academic struggling, etc. I won\u2019t back down and I\u2019m willing to be an open book and share real experiences regardless of whether they are negative if it helps someone. Believe me because one of my friends committed suicide last year and I want there to be more outlets like this site for honest discussion of all issues. Part of the reason why I loved this site was that it was \u201creal talk\u201d and that people could anonymously get advice for anything related to the university and it is easily and quickly accessible when things like the dean of the college aren\u2019t.\u000aIf you be more specific with what questions you had that were never answered, I promise you that I will personally answer them to the best of my ability regardless of whether the tone is sad.

V2-part question: Part of what made this site so great was the original staff never seemed to censor or refuse to post any question (assuming it was non-offensive - obviously, you shouldn't post racist or obscenely worded questions, etc.) But in last 3 years, probably wrote at least 30 questions - EVERY ONE posted. Since you brought site back after archive unfortunately deleted, I'd say only half or less of submitted questions posted. Unless breaking any standards or offensive, please publish all

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aLmao okay so you can drink whenever and not get in trouble. I actually really appreciate this policy because it allows students to get help or get their friends help when drunk without fear of punishment. Pregames will often get shut down due to noise complaints, but PSafe is understanding and will not try to get students in trouble unless some particularly egregious behavior was going on. The biggest rule is that you aren\u2019t allowed to have alcohol in public spaces, so you have to keep it in your room. Eating clubs, in general, are also only allowed to serve beer (and not hard liquor). Anything questionable (for instance, forcing someone to drink) is not allowed by the University. \u000aWeed is basically not allowed period, and if PSafe catches you with it or smells it in your room or something, you will get in trouble. There are some safer spaces on campus to smoke (i.e. Terrace), but you can actually face consequences for using any drug.

VResponse from Pablo:\u000aGreat! There are a ton of different kinds of jobs, ranging from those that make you do nothing to others that require a good deal of work. You can work at the library, do research with professors, tutor, help out at the Baby Lab (for developmental research), bake cookies, give tours, plan events, manage Princeton\u2019s social media, give swim lessons, give college counseling advice, drive students back to their dorms when they get locked out, work at Dillon Gymnasium, work at the Dining Hall etc. There are so many different jobs depending on what you\u2019re looking for! Haha, my roommate even counts psych studies as a job (which makes sense given that he\u2019s probably made $250+ therefrom at this point). The standard pay for jobs on campus is like $11/hr, although some jobs (managing student agencies/organizations around campus, tutoring, Writing Center) have increases in their pay grade. Plus, jobs on campus tend to be pretty flexible, which is really nice!\u000aIn terms of getting these jobs, there may definitely be some really great ones out there that are easier to get if you have \u201cthe plug\u201d or know someone who already works there. I say this, again, from personal experience. Still, most jobs are found through the Student Employment website with a regular old application.\u000aSo, I guess my main point is that there are really a ton of jobs available all over campus with decent pay and flexible hours. Getting a campus job will really depend on what you\u2019re looking for!

But I usually let it hit 7:30:01 second and then i press \u201cproceed to step 2 of 3\u2033 in the enroll thing. In the past I\u2019ve tried doing it right as it hit 7:30:00 but then it says I\u2019m too early, and then by the time I\u2019m able to go back to it again it\u2019s too late. So yeah I just do that and I\u2019ve been able to get into all my classes. Also make sure you log into TigerHub like at least 5 minutes before 7:30, cuz if you\u2019re too close to 7:30 there may be heavy traffic and you might not be able to get in.\u000aBut yeah, there\u2019s def some randomness, but \u201csuch is life,\u201d in the words of someone who I used to know\u000aResponse from Winnie P:\u000ajavascript is the bomb to get into your classes

VResponse from Edamame:\u000aIt\u2019s a different type of class than COS 217, much more math-focused with less of an emphasis on programming (although you will still have programming questions on problem sets). There\u2019s like one or two problem sets that are especially hard (took on the order of ~10 hours to complete) but most of them are more manageable. It\u2019s a good introduction to basic math proofs if you\u2019re not super familiar with that and a good introduction to computational programming (in MATLAB) if you\u2019re not familiar with that. Overall it\u2019s probably easier than 217 and taking both is definitely possible as they\u2019re different enough.

I know that I felt isolated as a frosh when I didn't get into any "cool" music groups; surprisingly, STEM clubs have become my social outlet.

Certainly, if you don\u2019t have a background in it, you can expect to invest a lot of time into learning as much as possible about it. And don\u2019t be surprised if some of your classmates already know what they\u2019re doing. But if it\u2019s something that you think sounds interesting, that\u2019s a really good reason to choose a topic/seminar, and you should absolutely go for it! (You\u2019ll be a lot more motivated when you\u2019re doing the project if it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in.)

As part of HIPAA, you will have your confidentiality protected and your doctor will not tell anyone about your condition unless you want to kill yourself or someone else.\u000aIn summary, only your doctor (who must write the prescription) will know about your decision. Mccosh will also make a medical record stating you take the medication that can be accessed by future doctors and health care providers in case you are allergic to a medication or something. I assume the pharmacist who prepares your prescription would learn too, but would not remember your name and details. You also get a receipt stating that you bought medication and they make a record that they prepared it for you. But as previously stated, no one other than you and the pharmacist will know. Your parents may also learn if you use medical insurance or use a credit card to buy the medication. They will ask you about the charges. But other than those people nobody will ever know unless you voluntary disclose the information.

I mean if your paper is half quotes that is probably too much but even then that wouldn\u2019t get you in trouble as long as you cited everyone, that just might get you a lower grade because your prof wants your own analysis, not other people\u2019s. I also think most professors are reasonable and if you do a citation in the wrong format or something they will not get you in trouble for it. It\u2019s pretty much only if you forget to put quotes around something which it sounds like is not something you would ever do.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI\u2019m so sorry to hear this! I actually was pretty bummed about how things between my prefrosh and I went as well. My MCAT is this week, so I really needed to get some studying done the night of preview. I got dinner with him (and my roommate and his prefrosh), but then he was pretty much on his own. I was out of the room studying until about 2am except for a quick rendezvous when my prefrosh got lost, and I left the gym to go bring him back to the room. I wish I had been able to spend the evening chilling in the room or something, but I really couldn\u2019t. I tried to get any questions he had answered during dinner and was upfront about having to go study and feeling badly about it. Sorry again @myprefrosh if you read this.\u000aI think your experience may just stem from it being a very busy time of the semester. A lot of students are stressed and busy about JPs and other big projects that are due soon. I don\u2019t think your experience at dinner was normal at all, though. I genuinely look forward to having dinner with prefrosh every year at preview. It\u2019s so refreshing to talk to you guys and see how excited you all are about the prospect of coming to Princeton. Sometimes I forget how great this place is and how lucky I am to be here, so it\u2019s a great reminder. I actually find it pretty ridiculous that your host didn\u2019t try to talk to you and answer your questions during dinner\u2026 Why host then, right? I\u2019d urge you to submit any questions you have that weren\u2019t answered to this site. We\u2019re always here and have some great insights! If you\u2019re looking for a more personalized conversation like you might have gotten with your host, you could send us an email into the inbox, and one of us could reach out to you directly to answer your questions.\u000aPlease don\u2019t let a ~terrible host steer you away from Princeton, though! Students here are generally much more helpful than it seems your host was, and I think you just got unlucky at Preview. It really sucks that that happened. Again, please submit your questions! We\u2019re here to help and hopefully mediate problems like your hosting-situation :)

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI am not a psychologist, but you stated that your are \u201cnot depressed\u201d but feel close to being chronically sad about your social life. Furthermore, you stated that you no longer have motivation to do something which you know you are able to and would make you happier. These symptoms such as a lack of motivation are common indicators of depression. It is also very common for depressed people to get \u201cused to being depressed\u201d to the point of not realizing the underlying issue. This sounds rather similar to your description of \u201cchronic sadness\u201d Before continuing, I suggest that you at least consider going to CPS and perhaps think about the possibility of depression. If you are afflicted by the mental illness, it will make your future goals exponentially more difficult.\u000aHowever, moving on now, I suggest that you try to connect with people who you could see yourself growing more close to. Your average day does not include a club/activity/extra-curricular outside of academia and basic life functions. I don\u2019t know what year your are, but have you considered joining an eating club? It\u2019s never too late and could be beneficial. You could also join casual clubs where people are just wanting to share their passions with other people in a non-competitive environment. Things as simple as SSBM club or Film clubs are great places if these things interest you. You will likely find people who share your other interests if you meet through one club where your interests meet. I would also recommend that you do not give up and actually try to make plans with people who your know, but are not yet close. Sometimes, they could make great close friends, but you must take the initiative. You don\u2019t have much to lose as the worse case scenario is that they just say no.\u000aLastly, I wouldn\u2019t compare yourself too much to other people. You have no idea whether other students are actually happy with their social lives just because they appear busy and having fun on the outside or social media. For all you know, they could feel like you and are looking for someone like you to find a connection with.

I barely even see anyone if I don't actively try to make plans and I don't feel like I belong in any social group. My day is basically wake up, go to class, do work, eat, and sleep, while it seems so busy and fun for other people. I'm not depressed but I feel so close to being chronically sad about my social life. I know I can try to make friends, but I no longer have any motivation to do so :(

VQuick PSA: The primary reason Classics majors have high GPAs is because most of them come in with years of Latin or Greek that make it possible to translate hundreds of lines per class relatively "easily." Not arguing that the difficulty comes close to trying to get a 4.0 in CBE, but for any pre-frosh reading this, Classics is not your "easy" major unless you have a significant background in the languages already. While it's definitely possible to start from scratch, it's much more difficult.

The average grade in CBE departmentals are B/B+ (skewing higher for upper-level classes), like other BSE majors and many other departments, so pretty reasonable. In an \u201caverage\u201d CBE departmental (not including core lab), I probably spend around 6 hours outside of class in a typical week, more if there\u2019s an exam or something of course \u2013 again, pretty typical and not unreasonable.

Vrf sf \u201816:\u000aI can\u2019t say for sure what he meant, but I remember a time when I was in a similar place. I think it came a lot from not wanting to rock the boat, not trying to disagree with people, and in the process, stopping myself from developing or expressing opinions. the thing is that opinions and arguments make for much more interesting and enjoyable conversations, and perhaps the best way to do develop your opinions is to talk them out with other people - as is the case for any idea (could be for a paper, political opinion, reflections on yourself/your strengths and weaknesses/your personal history, etc). try to avoid surrounding yourself from people with the same viewpoints though, cause echo chambers are a real thing (everywhere, not just at pton). hearing your referring to yourself as an introvert and wondering why your general friendliness has resulted in kind of stagnant, limited relationships made it seem like it may be a matter of your feeling uncomfortable with opening up or challenging people, so i\u2019m gonna focus the rest of this answer on that. hopefully this is relevant to you, or at least to someone out there.\u000aanother thing that resulted from not wanting to be controversial or polarize or offend anyone was me not expressing/being myself very much at all. like, being goofy or making jokes or sharing stories was not something I allowed myself to feel comfortable doing. at this stage, I think the way to get over this is to kind of push yourself to break down your own barriers and not filter yourself or your behavior. people will respond the way they will, and you\u2019ll probably find that they don\u2019t care as much as you fear they would and may actually enjoy that they\u2019re interacting with someone who has an actual personality and sense of humor and unique sets of quirks. in the process, you\u2019ll feel more comfortable in yourself and in interacting with others, and especially in the presence of this other person (if they react positively), and you\u2019ll end up feeling like you\u2019ve established a more substantial relationship. I\u2019ve described this process as being like perfecting a recipe (still a metaphor-in-progress): you test out different components of who you are and what the other person is like, see how they mesh, and adjust over time to find something that both people enjoy. hopefully, it\u2019s not just water, but a unique combination of spices and ingredients that come together to create an interesting and enjoyable product.\u000afriendliness/cordiality is surface-level stuff, but a more meaningful relationship requires a deeper, more complicated and nuanced connection. to get to that point, you may need to actively work to overcome any anxiety or fear of judgment that you may have when it comes to social interactions. to do that, you need to prove to yourself that rocking the boat is not as bad as you think.\u000a\u000ain short, push yourself to open up, act out of the norm, and try not to worry as much about what other people thing.\u000a\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000a^ I\u2019m a chick\u000aIn response to OP: For me, that means a relationship where we don\u2019t censor ourselves in pretty much any way. We know what the other person is thinking without them having to say it. We legitimately have each other\u2019s backs \u2014 like, in an I-won\u2019t-hesitate-to-fight-someone-on-your-behalf-and-have-probably-done-it-before kind of way. We empathize to a point where the other person\u2019s feelings can change how we\u2019re feeling. \u000aI literally feel this way about, like, 2 friends, and I didn\u2019t meet them until halfway through Princeton. In the meantime, it\u2019s not like your relationships are worthless. You can get a ton out of just knowing people here, since they tend to be pretty cool and interesting. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with friendly people you just say \u201chi\u201d to, or with having a few going out friends that you enjoy drinking with but barely know past the surface. Basically, don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s something \u201coff\u201d just because you haven\u2019t had the chance to meet your best friends yet <3 \u000aTotally not a rarity to be introverted, btw. I think it\u2019s more of a rarity to embrace it. I\u2019m super introverted and am perfectly happy not talking to people for days on end, but I definitely feel like TI\u2019s culture and some of my more extraverted friends sometimes shame me into, like, rejoining humanity when all I want to do is work on my thesis and browse /r/sloths.\u000a\u000areresponse from siggy floyd \u201816:\u000aoops sorry ziggy. fwiw, I really like your posts and advice : ) I think i assumed because of the similarities of our usernames

VAlright fine haha. I\u2019ll post some examples. I really hope this doesn\u2019t turn out to be a mistake I regret, but you asked nicely. Someone please send me a message if this is offensive. And another contributor can remove it if they feel like it as they\u2019re all a lot smarter than me. Lol, this feels so wrong, but I feel like this site is meant to help students and if this helps, then I guess it\u2019s ok.\u000a\u000aAs you can see, the bottom pic\u2019s filter (sepia) and lighting makes my abs look way smaller and flatter. The above pic as stronger shadow, but my eyes are harder to see. In these examples, focus should be away from my pecs so I also use my body to make them less pronouned. Also, the cropping in these photos ruins a lot of other things and blurs the images.\u000a\u000aThis was way back from my teenage days when my biceps were tiny and I was bordering on anerxeia tbh. One of the reasons why I\u2019m against some of the industry\u2019s policies. They wanted me to conform to to this slim body type for a while. But anyway, outdoor beach pics are always good  image, but shadow is very important as you can see.\u000aSelfie examples without any effect and/ or makeup should always be a portfolio as they want to know what you look like in real life too.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI started in Highschool as a Sales Representative (\u201dCashier\u201d) Model for Abercrombie and Fitch. In that position, I didn\u2019t do shoots and answer calls. It didn\u2019t make that much money and it was mainly for discounts, so I would not recommend this to a Pton student. Basically, I stood outside a New York branch and would help to answer questions about the clothes when I enticed a customer. Eventually, I started learning more about things like managing facial expressions as well as hanging out with the \u201creal\u201d models who were around for big promotional sales on black friday and other things. \u000aAbout a year later, I was comparing and sharing car photos with one of my friends who frequently attended car rallies I went to. She noticed all of my photos that weren\u2019t cars were shirtless stills and recommended that I take my modeling skills to the next level. She had already gotten pretty far up in a high class agency on Park Avenue and helped me get into an open call at a sister branch. I failed the first couple calls but eventually worked on my portfolio, interviewing skills, and endurance. A month later I got into a pretty good agency and started doing work for other companies like Lacoste and American Eagle. \u000aOnce I started college, I quit because it was too much time and I also didn\u2019t like a lot of the abuse, shaming, and drug use in the industry. However, literally this month, I kind of had a change of heart (and I need to pay rent for my internship) and I do think things are starting to change for the better. Most recently, I did some shooting for the same old agency for Tommy Hilfiger. \u000aNow for advice if you want to do this for fun and money:\u000a1. Know your body type: Are you going to be runway type, video, or most recently plus-size? Know the standard for each and try to best match to them. For example, I\u2019m only about average height and could never be a runway model. I usually do close up prints without leg shots with girls who are about the same height as me so we can both fit in the same frame with lots of body detail. My body type is athletic and not supper buff. \u000a2. Make a great portfolio: I\u2019m already a photographer so I could make my own pretty easily with help from a friend. You need a very high quality camera (I personally use a NIKON D7000), but they can be expensive. Another problem is that you need information on how to alter your look with shadows, lighting, and filters like sepia and b&w. If you don\u2019t have a friend that can help you for free, you will have to go to a professional photographer and tell them what you want. (I can post a face cropped out example if you really really really want)\u000a3. Diet, Exercise, and Body Maintenance: Unfortunately, for most male models, you need to shave all your armpit and chesthair. I actually blew my first open call when I accidentally ripped off a bunch of my skin in an embarrassing waxing mistake. You also need to keep your measurements, complexion, and weight very consistent. I was actually a vegan for a while for my skin a few years ago.\u000a4. Industry Knowledge: This mainly comes from experience. You have to learn things like all about measurements. You should know what your\u2019s are off the top of your head and what type of modeling you should be going for. You need to learn how to control breathing and flexing for photoshoots without straining yourself. You need to be able to work with the photographer and have a basic knowledge of what he/she is asking.\u000a5. This sounds horrible, but look in the mirror all the time and in front of friends. You have to be able to replicate certain looks and alter your body and face without looking at it all the time. For example, know which side of your face your dimples are larger and how to make it more pronounced without a mirror, but not to the point where you look too happy or high.\u000a6. Confidence (either fake or real) is what agencies want\u000aDo all this and you may have a pretty good shot. Failure on the first few tries is very common though, so make sure you have a positive attitude. Agencies like smiley, bubbly, docile models. Personality is actually relatively important and they won\u2019t hire people who they can\u2019t stand to work hours with at a time.\u000aHope that helps.

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aAre you trying to lose weight (lose fat) or put on weight and gain muscle? Gyms can definitely be intimidating for newcomers, but if you go consistently for a few weeks, you will become comfortable, i guarantee you. you just need to devote yourself, not just go like once a month and being lazy.\u000aMaybe find a friend to go with if you\u2019re feeling insecure. If you have a decently close friend who clearly works out, hit him/her up! I feel like it might make you less insecure, since while you may not look like you work out, your workout partner does, so people will be less judge-y. Princeton\u2019s gym is like most gyms, it has cardio machines and weight machines upstairs and free weights downstairs, as well as separate rooms with more cardio machines. If you\u2019re tryna lose some pounds, then do the cardio machines, anything that\u2019ll make you sweat. If you\u2019re tryna gain some muscle, then watch some youtube videos on how to lift, and then do them in the weights area.\u000aif you\u2019re kind of in between and have some body fat that you wanna lose but also don\u2019t have much muscle and you want to gain muscle, then that\u2019s the awkward stage. it\u2019s called skinny-fat. you kinda just gotta make a choice of whether u will focus on gaining muscle which means lifting more and eating more and getting a little fatter, or focusing on losing fat and thus watching your diet and doidng more cardio and you gotta accept that you\u2019re probably not gonna have huge muscles anytime soon.\u000aagain idk if you\u2019re a guy/girl, what kind of reason ur wanting to go to the gym for, and most of my advice is bro-science. but point is yeah the gym can be intimidating for newcomers, go with a friend to feel less insecure, and do research on how to work out.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000a4 + IW, I think. It\u2019s really just another 5-class semester. (More like 4.5-class semester, tbh.) IW is truly not as bad as people make it out to be, so long as you just start early in the semester and do a little bit each week. Also, you\u2019re supposed to pick something that you\u2019re actually interested in, which makes it 10,000 times more bearable than normal class work.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000a(1) If you want to make friends, be open-minded about everything and everyone. (2) Go to class. (3) Don\u2019t let FOMO get the best of you. The street will always be there. (And, yes, you will get bored of it, no matter how fun it seems now. Find other things that are also fun.) (4) That being said, don\u2019t miss out on truly once-in-a-lifetime opportunities or experiences. Sometimes, that pset can wait. (5) Don\u2019t underestimate your midterms. They will be harder than you expect, and you probably won\u2019t do well unless you use the materials provided for you. (6) Professors aren\u2019t scary, and office hours are worth it. I wouldn\u2019t say you should just go for the sake of going, but don\u2019t hesitate to meet up with them if you have legitimate questions. (7) Don\u2019t give your email to every club at the Activities Fair. (Make one lap and come back to the 2 or 3 that you actually have time for/are interested in.) (8) Along the same vein, don\u2019t overcommit yourself. You can always add clubs later if you actually have more time than you expected to. (Unlikely.) (9) If you want a paid summer internship, start working on that as soon as you can. Like, before winter break is not too early. It\u2019ll set you up for some stellar jobs sophomore year, which will in turn give you the pick of whatever you\u2019re interested in junior year. Your friends may think you\u2019re crazy, but you\u2019ll thank yourself when it\u2019s time for full-time recruiting. (10) Resolve your roommate problems like the adults that you are. It\u2019s a lot better to have one uncomfortable discussion than to live in resentment for a year. (11) Make time for the gym. It\u2019s not a waste of time, and you\u2019ll study and feel better. (12) Don\u2019t get caught up in our shitty social system. The clubs will be there 2 years from now \u2013 which is the only time you should start seriously thinking about them. For now, just enjoy the free beer and work on making meaningful relationships \u2013 which will last a lot longer than your \u2018affiliations.\u2019 (13) Always balance out your classes. You DON\u2019T want a dean\u2019s date with 5 papers, and you don\u2019t want to study for 5 finals. Be smart about what you\u2019re picking. (14) Just because your high school started at 7:40 am does NOT mean that an 8:00 am in college will be easy. Just be careful with that. (15) Read course and professor reviews before enrolling in anything. A bad professor can make a fascinating subject boring, and a great professor can make literally anything fun. (16) Ask RTP if you have any more questions :)\u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000adamn Ziggy spits straight facts\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI have a lot of thoughts when I\u2019m procrastinating on my thesis.\u000aResponse from Amygdala: DO A SEMESTER ABROAD.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI think this is a pretty difficult question to answer. If you are a prefrosh and choosing between the two, I don\u2019t think going in with the mindset that one is \u201cless boring than the other\u201d is going to help you make the most optimal choice. I don\u2019t recommend picking majors here depending on popularity or wall street prospects and I encourage all pre-frosh to find true passions instead.\u000aBut back to your question. Workloads are tough to compare because the type of work is so different a lot of times. For example, WWS has more of a language requirement compared to ECO. If you don\u2019t have an aptitude for learning languages and/or don\u2019t already have credit, you will find the workload and class hours to be substantial. On the flip side, the ECO major requires a more rigorous statistics course compared to WWS in order to do Econometrics. You also have to remember, that even within the ECO major, there are two paths: math track and less-math track each with varying levels of difficulty depending on the quantitative abilities of the student. But overall, I would say that most people at Princeton think ECO is harder than WWS. But we have to take much fewer classes, only 5 departmentals in addition to the 3 core classes.\u000aAs for being boring, this is once again completely subjective. Some people think ECO and its theory are boring, unrealistic, and a waste of time. Some people think WWS courses are exactly the same way. A lot of the people who major in these fields pick them because they like them and the content, not because they are just the least boring/worst of the choices.

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aSo it\u2019s kind of agreed upon by most that Tower and Cannon have the best food. I believe they both have the same catering company or something, they\u2019re way of ordering is different than most clubs; you go to a touch screen and order what you want (lots of customizable options, you can customize basically anything) and then the kitchen makes it to order (well some of the stuff is cooked beforehand obviously, or else it would take forever to get everyone\u2019s food out). \u000aI\u2019ve only eaten at Tower, Cannon, Terrace and Ivy so I can only speak directly about those clubs. Terrace food is not bad, it\u2019s like dhall style but much less options (a few choices in terms of hot items, usually hit-or-miss, but good vegetarian options so a lot of vegetarians like to sign in). Ivy dinner they have servers who tell you what options they have that day and you tell them your order (I think it\u2019s usually like a couple of more complex dishes, and then they also have plainer options like chicken over rice if people don\u2019t like the more complex things offered that day). I liked it a lot when I went for dinner (they had steak that day). Ivy lunch was pretty good when I went too (no servers, just dhall style).\u000aMy friends in cap don\u2019t really rave about the food, especially my vegetarian friend in cap (who may or may not be a contributor). I haven\u2019t eaten there yet, but i gotta complete a meal exchange there soon so I\u2019ll probs find out what it\u2019s like. Other than that I haven\u2019t heard anything substantial from people in other clubs about their food

Vcurrently struggling a bit w a nihilistic crisis of sorts...i don't really know what i want to do post-graduation (not even down to a field), and i'm nervous that when i do figure it out, i'll be in the wrong major and it'll be too late to switch, and then i'll graduate w a degree that doesnt qualify me to be working in the field i actually want to work in. i know it's kind of broad, but any advice?

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aOkay, yes, that\u2019s horrible. I would be pissed and freaked out beyond belief if a guy ever did that to me. I understand not wanting to be lonely, but lying about your relationship with someone, and then lying again to cover it up in a way that reflects poorly on her is not the way to make her like you, or just to behave in general. If she confronts you about it, you need to apologize profusely, and be thankful that you only have a few weeks of school left.\u000aIn the future, concentrate on forming tangible, real relationships with people that you\u2019re interested in. The lying scenario didn\u2019t benefit anyone. It didn\u2019t make her interested in you and it didn\u2019t provide you any fulfillment. The only thing it did was provide a false narrative to others, who probably didn\u2019t care either way. I\u2019m sorry if this answer sounds harsh, but think very seriously about doing something like that again in the future.

As their graduation is at the end of that week, most seniors stay through the entire thing, though many do travel during beach week/dead week. \u000aFood depends on the person. Many of the different eating clubs are open, or at least allow different clubs to order meal plans for dead week and reunions. It will be very dependent on the situation. There are several events throughout Reunions that include free food. The other food options include Frist, eating out, or cooking for yourself.

But I can absolutely guarantee you that we are not posting selectively. We answer the questions that we get, unless they are extremely obnoxious and don\u2019t belong on the site. If people aren\u2019t asking touchy/controversial questions, we can\u2019t answer them. For the past several months, we\u2019ve routinely had only a few unanswered questions in the inbox, which means that we\u2019re answering almost every question that we get.

VResponse from Edamame:\u000aPrinceton has a very strong residential college system (required to stay in-college until junior year, massive amounts of participation in residential college activities/funding for residential colleges). The presence of eating clubs is also not really something to stress about before coming here \u2013 some ridiculous 70-80% of people join them and almost half of the clubs are sign-in (which means no rush-like process) so they\u2019re really quite accessible. There are also non-eating club options that don\u2019t get talked about enough (e.g. co-ops), which are also great options. What exactly about the eating clubs have you heard is stressful?\u000a\u000aresponse from sigmund floyd \u201816:\u000afirst of all, congrats! it\u2019s tough to get into one of these schools, let alone two. either way, you can\u2019t go wrong. \u000aI\u2019ve also heard that yale\u2019s res col system is very strong, though I\u2019m not too sure how that translates into a better experience overall (im just not familiar enough)\u000aas for pton, I think the res col system does a good job of bringing people together in the same place, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that people will meet everyone or befriend all of them. the res col\u2019s have a good number of events for their residents and the RCAs (if you have a good one - if you don\u2019t, just go partake in the events of a hall with a good RCA and some of your friends [but ask permission first]) also host weekly events for their halls that dedicate time to bringing the hallmates together and developing a sense of community amongst them. \u000aWhat I think is important to keep in mind is that the friendships you make are less dependent on the type/quality of the dorm you\u2019re in and more about finding \u201cyour people\u201d and developing a relationship with them. Wherever you end up, I recommend hosting or suggesting events to invite people over and give you a chance to grow comfortable with each other and find shared interests/hobbies. some good ones are board games, super smash bros, tv shows/movies, playing frisbee, or working out (just listing random ones). \u000aeating clubs can be stressful, for sure, but they can also be a great community if you approach it the right way. to be clear, it\u2019s not about drinking or partying when it comes to joining an eating club, nor should you think of it as a chance to \u201csocial climb\u201d or make connections with potentially influential people. ideally, joining an eating club is about finding a place where you\u2019d like to be with your friends, particularly if you\u2019re trying to join with the friends you had before the time comes when you can join an eating club. it\u2019s like, lunch and dinner increasingly become the optimal time for socializing and seeing friends and relaxing, so it helps if you like the sort of people in your eating club or if you already know that there\u2019s a set of people you\u2019d like to be with in it. for the bicker clubs, it really helps to already know people in the club, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should try to network - it\u2019s usually more about whom you know from your extracurriculars. within eating clubs, social hierarchies can arise (as they would anywhere - including at Yale), but that doesn\u2019t mean that the eating club ceases to serve as a place where you can enjoy yourself with your friends. to be more specific about the whole thing, bicker is probably the worst part of eating clubs, especially if you or a friend ends up not getting into a club, but it\u2019s not the end of the road (you can still try to join a club that semester or another semester if you still want to - and it\u2019s easier to join when you know more people in the club) and the sting wears off over time. \u000ait is also worth mentioning that upperclassman social life does not center completely around the eating clubs - a lot of great people choose instead to live and cook independently or to join a co-op (which are growing increasingly popular). you can still get meals like once a month and hangout with people at eating clubs.\u000aall in all, I think you can\u2019t go wrong with your decision, and both places will have their faults (I just tried to be transparent when outlining the ones above), but what\u2019s important is not to paralyze or filter yourself with worry about making friends and to instead just try to invest in the experiences and people that you find that you enjoy.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aIt\u2019s a requirement for juniors concentrating in MOL. In the fall, you are placed in a tutorial group (about 10-15 students) which is led by a post-doc in the MOL department. You are assigned a paper from the primary literature each week (and often a review paper for background that isn\u2019t always necessary to read). You\u2019re expected to read the paper and write a summary that includes criticism of the paper. Each week, the tutorial meets for 1.5 hours and discusses the assigned paper. The tutorial is separated into 2 segments/parts. The first half of the semester you are with one post-doc reading papers on a specific topic. Then, you write the first JP which is on the same topic. It\u2019s basically a critical review of another paper. Then, you stay in the same group but get a new post-doc and go through the whole process again. The papers you read are all about a new topic (whatever the post-doc does research in). Then you write the 2nd JP which is the same format as the first. \u000aI really, really enjoyed the MOL tutorial. I got much better at critical analysis of papers. I\u2019d done it before, but I always found myself summarizing, not criticizing / thinking about what controls are missing, what could\u2019ve been done better, what results aren\u2019t really believable. I also got lucky because my first half tutorial was on herpesviruses (what my thesis is on lol) and the second half was on tissue engineering. I was super interested in both which was definitely helpful. You don\u2019t get to choose or rank your preferences for topics, sadly. They simply wouldn\u2019t be able to accommodate everyone.\u000aLet me know if you have any more questions about this or anything else MOL-related!

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aTop med schools as in top 10 schools? For most of those, the median GPA accepted from Princeton is just under a 3.8 (3.75 probably is more accurate, since only Harvard/Stanford/etc. will have 3.8 median). \u000aI think bringing your GPA up from a 3.4 to a 3.8 is a bit of a stretch. Classes don\u2019t get easier, you just get slightly better at handling the Princeton premed workload and taking exams here. Getting it up to a 3.6 is a good goal though. You can certainly get into a good med school with a 3.6, a good MCAT, good extra curriculars\u2026  \u000aResponse from a Ziggy:\u000aJust to add my own story, I finished freshman year with a 3.4, and I expect to have a +/- 3.7 when I graduate. I think what really helped the most was IW \u2013 that\u2019s four grades that you can knock out of the park if you put enough effort into it. I also made sure to pad all of my hard COS classes with more manageable workloads, and I dropped the extracurriculars that didn\u2019t mean very much to me. Given that I definitely still wasn\u2019t pulling straight A\u2019s, it\u2019s very possible to bump yours up a few points.\u000aResponse from Winnie P:\u000aI think it\u2019s for sure possible. I will end this year with a GPA .2 higher than I had at the end of freshman year. I think that actually a lot can change between frosh and sophomore years!! I don\u2019t really know what it was, but for me everything got a ton easier.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aHonestly this is impossible to answer. They post \u2018tentative curves\u2019 for each exam with grade boundaries for that exam. My year, for one of the exams, an 88 or something was necessary for an A, while the other exam required a 78 or something. It definitely varies a lot by exam. The curves are never too huge though (it\u2019s not a terribly difficult class; lots of people end up getting raw score As).

VResponse from Pichu:\u000awell I can tell you where I stayed, but it\u2019s not cheap. To be honest, to find a nice place that\u2019s cheap, I would just diligently search Airbnb to find one that\u2019s right for you. Airbnb in China is not that bad and it is very possible to find great-value places on there (my friend found this dope ass apartment in Shanghai for like $35/night last summer, it was super cheap cuz it was a new posting). Using other sites on the internet to find like apartment postings in China is just either really sketchy or the postings aren\u2019t accurate or they\u2019re fake.\u000aI stayed in a service apartment in the \u4e16\u8d38\u5929\u9636 (shi mao tian jie) mall complex. My family was familiar with the area cuz we owned an apartment across from it, so we just found these service apartments and my mom just helped me book it. But definitely not what you\u2019re looking for if you\u2019re looking for a cheap place. It\u2019s literally in a mall; tons of American/European stores, shitload of amazing restaurants, and a super lit nightclub called Spark all like just an elevator ride down from where I was living. And super close to sanlitun, gongti, and a bunch of dope restaurants and bars and places, ah i miss it so much. here\u2019s a link to the apartments, mine was exactly what the pictures look like, although i don\u2019t think we booked it on a website, my mom just found a phone number and called them to book. I believe it was about 17000 rmb per month for me.\u000ahttps://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/beijing-shimao-tianjie.zh-cn.html\u000aBut if you\u2019re looking for less of a crazy place, Airbnb is the way to go. If you are not very familiar with Beijing and don\u2019t really know what area to look for for apartments in relation to where you\u2019re working, where good places are to hang out, etc., you can ask more questions!

Yes, I'm class valedictorian, in Calc BC, and have taken AP Chem/Physics/Biology, but I do not consider myself innately  intellectual, just someone who works harder than most.  Also, what other 2 courses are recommended to take with it each semester that may require less attention?

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aHappy to hear! Hope you enjoy your time here as it will be both different and enriching. But with regards to your question, the numbers simply refer to what level the course is and who the course is designed for.\u000aFor example SPA (Spanish) 101 is a beginner course meant for undergraduates. SPA 207 is still meant for undergraduates, but they generally have a solid foundation in the language. A SPA course above 400 is usually a smaller seminar for graduates students (maybe one or two undergraduate concentrators) and will most likely be a more in-depth study of a facet of Spanish culture and/or history. Students in these courses are generally expected to be close to level C1 on the European language scale. 400 and especially 500 level courses are usually for graduate students only, although undergraduates can sometimes enroll with special permission. The number levels are also valid for all courses, not just languages for consistency purposes. So basically,\u000a100-300 = Undergraduates\u000a400 = Mix of Graduates and Junior/Senior (3rd and 4th year) undergraduates\u000a500 = Almost entirely graduates with maybe a few Undergraduates.

When I went to preview i ate at the eating club of someone from my high school, my parents ate at the tent and said it was shit. I guess eating at the tent is nice to meet other prefrosh and parents to meet other parents, but my parents were not particularly fond of any parents they met there either. \u000aI would suggest if you know a current student, maybe eat w them in their eating club or dhall, or get a group of people to eat on nassau, or eat w ur parents on nassau (this is for lunch). For dinner, you eat in the dhall with your host, I think parents are on their own.\u000aThis was for my preview which was only for one day, no overnight stay.

I\u2019ve found that we learned everything needed for biochem on the mcat in fall biochem. Granted, I haven\u2019t taken it in the spring, so that might be the case for spring biochem as well. Also my thesis advisor teaches it in the spring! She\u2019s so smart and is an incredible human and is somehow always happy \u000aI don\u2019t think it really matters when you take it. If you\u2019re worried about time and your sport, take it in the spring. If you take it in the fall, just make sure you don\u2019t take a bunch of difficult classes with it.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aMake sure to check back for Nick and SF\u2019s responses as they are actually applying to medical school from Pton and their experiences are important to your question. I don\u2019t know about law school students on this site though.\u000aBut back to your question, of course top med schools and law schools take into account the difficulty of Princeton. The real concern is the DEGREE to which they factor that into their decision. I come from a family of doctors and my dad used to read medical school applications at U of R and P&S. Considering that there are thousands of applicants applying to top schools for a couple hundred spots (literally more or less a 2% acceptance rate), they don\u2019t have time to really look through all your credentials throughly. If you don\u2019t meet a certain GPA or MCAT score, it doesn\u2019t matter if you went to Pton, you won\u2019t make it to the interview round unless you are some kind of special case. They don\u2019t read all the fine print on your transcript like \u201cfrom 2003-2014, grade deflation\u2026\u201d and studies clearly show that top med/law schools prefer higher GPA\u2019s regardless. I think a good example to illustrate this would be one of my close friends who graduated from Columbia, cum laude, with a top GPA (probably around 3.7). Most of us would agree that the 3.7 means more there than at a place like Harvard. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t make the cut for her, and she did not get accepted to any school including all the SUNYS on the first try. Demographics and MCAT scores may have had a negative influence in this though. On her second try now, she\u2019s on the waiting list at UB and Temple.\u000aTo make it simple, you should probably only add about a .1-.15 to your GPA from Princeton for top medical schools. Going to Princeton WILL HELP YOU OUT, but you can\u2019t expect the name alone to be indispensable in getting you a spot. It\u2019s just hard no matter what and you should be proud just to get into even 1 MD school. But on a more positive note, I think most people here at Pton still will be able to achieve their dreams if they want to be a doctor or lawyer. The road may be tough, but most people get into a medical school that is reasonably high on their list and are able to pursue successful careers. You don\u2019t have to go to Hopkins to be a top doctor. My mom went to New York Medical College (ever heard of it?\u2026 I didn\u2019t think so) and she ended up doing her residency at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital (Harvard). Keep working hard in school and deepen your resume, and things will probably still work out in the end even if there are some tough moments along the way.\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aYeah, so I\u2019m applying to med school this spring. I\u2019ll just reiterate one part of what Maybach said in his response. HPA has this awesome excel spread sheet of all the med schools where Princeton students have applied over the past 5 years or so. They break down what the average GPA and MCAT score for Princeton admits to each school is, and there are other columns that have average GPA and MCAT score for everyone entering. Generally I\u2019ve found that Princeton admits have about a .15 lower average GPA than the rest of admitted students. So if a school\u2019s average is 3.95, the average Princeton admit gets in with a  3.8. Med schools do take it into account.\u000aAlso, something like 95% of premeds get into med schools from Princeton. Check the HPA site for the exact statistic, but the acceptance rate is very high. Just to put it in perspective, the median GPA of the ~30 juniors applying to med school this year is a 3.78. That\u2019s in line with the average Princeton accepted GPA to schools like Harvard. Many students with less-competitive GPAs end up taking a gap year to improve their chances at getting into med school. So the average GPA of the ~50 seniors applying is a 3.6. \u000aI guess I\u2019m not the best person to answer a question like this. I\u2019ve been able to maintain a high and competitive GPA by working hard. I think I\u2019d be more pessimistic about the rigor here and its effects on premeds if I was being negatively impacted by it.

I got a 70 on my regents exam and they didn\u2019t seem to care and I didn\u2019t even get a warning. If you are really worried, maybe send admissions an email and also explain why the grade might be lower. I think they would understand as long the reason isn\u2019t senioritus.\u000aOther people can share their experiences, but I\u2019ve only ever heard of someone getting rescinded over behavior/legal issues. Most people with the ability to get into Pton are able to maintain reasonably close to their previous academic performance.

I think Cs are the area where it starts to get a little iffy, but it\u2019s hard for us to say. Maybe explain the situation to your teacher and ask if there\u2019s absolutely anything you can do to improve your grade / do for extra credit? I honestly think the chances your admission would actually get rescinded are slim, but better safe than sorry! I had a friend who got a warning letter from Columbia over a similar situation. Honestly though my grades went to shit at the end of my senior year\u2026 pretty sure they dropped a solid 5 pts on a 100 pt grading scale? I think I literally went to school for 5 days in April or something ridiculous, and they didn\u2019t say anything. But again, it\u2019s really better safe than sorry, so talk to your math teacher and hopefully they\u2019ll understand! If push comes to shove, and you\u2019re trying your hardest, hopefully the admissions office will understand as well (especially if you\u2019ve had Bs all four years).

VResponse from Sparverius:\u000aHonestly just think about which subject you\u2019ll enjoy more. Neuro will make it slightly easier to get premed requirements in, but not as much as something like mol, since things like orgo and biochem won\u2019t count towards your major. It also depends on how committed you are to premed\u2014if there\u2019s even the slightest chance you\u2019ll change your mind, I\u2019d recommend at least getting the prereqs in for COS/ORF so that you have that option available.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aPlease double check all of this with the financial aid office, as financial aid plans are usually personal! This is just what I\u2019ve experienced with my financial aid plan. So if you have some type of excuse as to why you weren\u2019t able to work a job this summer (for instance, you had an unpaid internship), then Princeton will replace half the summer savings amount with a grant. The way actually paying the money works is a little complicated. There are res college fees and such that you\u2019re responsible for that are intended to be paid for by summer savings. So if you don\u2019t work, there\u2019s still a number of different things that you\u2019ll have to pay for. Again, what things and how much will really depend on how much aid you receive. Anything left over from paying your expected contributions can be used for personal expenses. I STRONGLY encourage you to give them a call, because I have talked to them about a million times about this exact issue, and still don\u2019t really understand it, and we can\u2019t speak to your particular FA plan!

I usually try to fill half of it up with salad or veggies, then a quarter up with brown rice or pasta or a starch, and then have some type of protein in the other corner. If worse comes to worst, I will literally pile chickpeas or quinoa on whatever I\u2019m eating. I\u2019m also trying to loose weight atm, and burn about 700 calories at the gym every night!

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI still would recommend a single if you are \u201cpicky\u201d about your neatness. A significant portion of college students in general aren\u2019t exactly tidy by a lot of peoples\u2019 standards. You can\u2019t have certainty that you won\u2019t be paired with someone who doesn\u2019t meet your level of neatness.\u000aAlso, I wouldn\u2019t worry about not getting the \u201ccollege experience\u201d because a lot of singles are grouped together and things like the Zee group and other dorm functions strengthen social relationships. For example, in Whitman, my friend had a hall that was basically only singles, so everyone was encouraged to seek the other students out and many started hanging out together.\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aAlso, it\u2019s highly likely that you won\u2019t even get a single if you put that down on your housing form as your preferred room type. I know lots of people who wrote single on the form but ended up in doubles/quads (or vice versa if they put suite as preferred). They simply can\u2019t accommodate everyone, and they have to fill rooms. I would recommend suite-style living, though. It made my freshman year a lot more enjoyable (especially in the beginning when trying to make friends), and you can live in a single for your other three years if that\u2019s your thing.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aIt\u2019s going to be very different for everyone and is totally dependent on your fellow hall/suite mates. I lived in Forbes my freshman year and I had a single in a tight corner on a higher floor. There was literally NEVER significant noise or disruption because nobody held parties, pre-games, etc.\u000aI know other people in different areas and residential colleges with the opposite experience. Therefore, it is pretty much luck of the draw. Although if noise is ever a problem, you can always talk to an RCA about it and usually get it resolved. \u000aResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aIt\u2019s super loud in Pyne on nights out (that\u2019s in upperclassmen housing). The walls are also super thin, so I can sometimes here the girl in the room next to me talking. Sometimes I turn my fan on just to hide the noise if I\u2019m trying to sleep relatively early. I\u2019m also a super light sleeper though, and it\u2019s not really that much of a problem. I\u2019d describe it more as a slight nuisance. But yea, definitely depends on where you live.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI strongly recommend relaxing, traveling, and hanging out with friends. Your senior summer will be like no other summer ever again and I suggest you make the most of it. Once you start college, life with your high school friends will be completely different (not necessarily worse) than what you have now and savoring these moments is precious.\u000aI would also note that this summer will be one of your freest for a long while with no internships or summer courses/seminars to deal with. Take that time to enjoy life before having to work very hard again and also rejuvenate before starting Princeton. However, if you really want to get ahead in any way (which some concerned pre-frosh have asked before), I would start thinking about your future course load and maybe do some light studying or reading. For example, if you know you are going to take the Spanish placement test, study up before taking it in order to get an accurate representation.

Another option is to network and kind of work the playing field that way. I also recommend going to Career Services for an advising appointment. I\u2019ve done it multiple times, and thought it was pretty helpful! They can look over your resume and cover letter and go over search strategies with you.

VResponse from Olivia Pope:\u000aI would agree with the latter, that it\u2019s only as big as you make it. I think how much weight you give to eating clubs depends on the friend groups that you hang out with. For instance, if all of your friends are in one eating club and you are not then it will probably play a much bigger role in your Princeton experience than it would otherwise. It is true that eating clubs make up most of the regular nightlife on the weekends but, that being said, there are always other events going on like acapella arch sings, dance performances, comedy shows, guest speakers, USG movies (a personal favorite), among others. I really would not fret about eating clubs. If they seem interesting to you, go ahead and bicker or sign-in. I think WAY too much importance is placed on them pre-sophomore spring. It really doesn\u2019t matter, but I don\u2019t think people start realizing that till junior year.

This is your academic advisor.\u000aYou also get a PAA (peer advisor), who\u2019ll introduce themselves to you once you\u2019re at school. \u000aYour res college advisor will probably send you an email after you have your res college, or maybe closer to school\u2019s start.

VResponse from Exupery:\u000a(my two cents; you\u2019ll hear different opinions from different people) CBE as a field is pretty broad and versatile, and there\u2019s a whole array of stuff you can do with a CBE degree. CBE undergraduate courses, though, are mostly pretty awful and for the majority of people, they\u2019re uninteresting and irrelevant (beyond developing general problem solving skills / getting good at hard problems, which is useful in its own right but still). I have generally found CBE not that bad and had more or less come to terms with it until core lab this semester. Core lab is the single worst course experience I\u2019ve ever had in my entire education. I\u2019ve never put such an unbelievable number of hours of work into something so utterly senseless, though it\u2019ll at least be better next year because they\u2019re changing up the professors. \u000aI\u2019m glad I\u2019m CBE because I probably wouldn\u2019t have figured out what I really want to do after graduation without all the frustration and career-related uncertainty I experienced. But if I could take what I know now and redo Princeton, I would definitely be COS or ORF. \u000ai encourage someone with a more generous view of CBE to contribute as well to balance out my cynical perspective lol

There won\u2019t be any curve on individual exams, just on final letter grades (assuming that the desired X% of people don\u2019t have raw scores over 93).

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aEdited (last response was wrong):\u000aIt is absolutely NOT unheard of to get in as a freshman. That being said, it can be hard (depending on the position of course) because many of the applicants were all-state and/or very serious musicians in HS. I know several people who were experienced (private lessons, orchestra, years of playing) but got rejected from positions like violin. Still audition though! There are always people who get in with less experience and it\u2019s suppose to be like a family with great trips to Europe and other places.\u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aOkay most of this is not right so I will clear it up for you. \u000aI\u2019m assuming that by \u201cPrinceton Symphony Orchestra\u201d you mean \u201cPrinceton University Orchestra\u201d (PUO). Princeton Symphony Orchestra is a professional group whose membership is made up of adult musicians, so I doubt that a freshman or student in general would join. \u000aIt is not \u201cabsolutely unheard of\u201d to get into PUO as a freshman. Dozens of new freshmen join the group every year. There are a lot of talented musicians at Princeton, yes, but it is ridiculous to say that the group doesn\u2019t accept freshmen. As with most things here, it\u2019s a high-caliber group, and you will need to be a very serious musician to join. But literally dozens of freshmen are accepted every year. Don\u2019t let the above response discourage you from auditioning. There are also several other instrumental groups that you can join if you aren\u2019t accepted the first time around.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aDon\u2019t worry, you have so much time! You figure most of it out on your own, and then you meet with your advisor and your PAA to talk about what might be good for you to take. Some things, you may have to take. For example- BSE prereqs, language classes, writing sem, etc. You may also want to consider any prereqs for your major, any potential subjects you might be interested in, and also if you\u2019re considering pre-med. You can also consider taking a freshman seminar (although I don\u2019t think the course offerings have been released yet). Tbh, I would just look through the course catalog and see what jumps out at you! That\u2019s what I did! In my case, I presented my advisor and PAA with about 6 classes that I was considering, and narrowed it down to 4. But you have lots of time, so don\u2019t worry! :)

Vresponse from sigmund floyd \u201816 and anything clever \u201817:\u000aHey, so first of all, if you\u2019re having any kind of serious consideration of suicide or self harm, there are support systems on and off campus built to help you. If you are comfortable, contact the CPS counselor on call line at 609-258-3139; otherwise, there are incredible counselors and therapist on Nassau. \u000aIf you feel comfortable/close enough with your parents to let them know what you\u2019re going through, I would do so. Your RCA, if you have one, is another person you can talk to about this. Also, Suicide Hotlines are an incredible resource. Just know that there are people who care for you and are rooting for you to be okay. We are two of those people.\u000aAs far as your friends go, I think you need to be explicit with them, maybe one on one or in a group. Princeton can be awful and absorbing for people and it can be hard to see for people to see beyond their own pain, so your friends really may not realize that something is wrong. You can\u2019t assume that it\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d until you tell them, in a real and honest conversation without downplaying how you are feeling. (That does not mean this is just a you problem. This just means it is hard to know what is happening in someone else\u2019s head unless they tell you, even if it\u2019s a close friend. Many people struggle with mental health on this campus, you should not feel alone or at fault.) \u000aThese conversations are also not easy to start or to have, so it may help for you to explicitly say that you need someone to console you or make you feel better because X. Often, just having someone hear your dilemmas and acknowledge them can be therapeutic on its own.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI would take neither of these sequences as a premed. Definitely do not take 103/104. That\u2019s calculus based, generally for engineers, and won\u2019t help you for MCAT prep as much because there is no calculus on the MCAT. PHY 101/102 is fine (definitely better for premeds than 103/104 and a more popular option for premeds in general). Ideally, you should take PHY 101/108. I had AP physics credit, so I am only taking PHY 108 (I\u2019m taking it now). It teaches you 60% of the concepts covered on the MCAT for physics. All the problems are also framed in a life sciences perspective, so it\u2019s a bit more engaging than your average physics course. Though it\u2019s still physics\u2026 \u000a101/102 or 101/108 are both fine, though. I would recommend the latter.

My experience with the waitlist was overwhelmingly positive, and I think you\u2019re lucky that you weren\u2019t one of the last people to draw (i.e., crappy but assured room).

Vresponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000anon-STEM pre-med is actually more common than you\u2019d think! personally, I think it\u2019s more important to do a thesis whose work you\u2019d enjoy and whose subject matter is more interesting to you than to pursue a major just because you think it\u2019s more medicine-related. It would definitely help if your independent work relates to medicine in some way, but it\u2019s not necessary. You might be selling yourself short if you major in something you don\u2019t want to do and not developing skills that could come in handy later or that you\u2019ve already invested in prior to starting at Pton.\u000a\u000aHPA is a good place to start, and as long as you get the pre-med requirements out of the way and do well on the MCAT to demonstrate scientific competency, your major is really not that important. HPA has a very interesting breakdown of school acceptances by major, and you\u2019d see that some of the top schools actually accept more non-STEM majors than STEM majors. I guess it\u2019s like, everyone is gonna be good enough at science, but not everyone has a way of appreciating or adding to the humanistic side of medicine, so people who are humanities majors have more opportunities and support to demonstrate that they value and can contribute to that side of medicine. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d bargain that the individuals who do non-STEM majors but then do medically-related work have an easier time discussing their work and how it plays into their interest in medicine, but then again, some of the less obviously medically-related fields (e.g. art history, literature, music) offer some of the more interesting connections to medicine (see here for some examples: https://medicalhumanities.ucsf.edu/ or https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/medicines-search-for-meaning/ - about a course that is being offered at many medical schools now called \u201cThe Healing Art\u201d).

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI\u2019m not going to lie, they\u2019re very selective. For some groups, over 100 people audition in the fall, and only a few end up getting picked. However, there are two things to keep in mind. First, there are a ton of people who are totally tone-deaf who audition, and power to them (I respect it), but they just aren\u2019t as likely to get picked. Second, a huge factor of a cappella auditions is not just how good of a singer you are, but how much you blend with the group. You could be an amazing singer, but if you don\u2019t blend with the other singers well, you don\u2019t have a great chance of getting chosen. My personal suggestion is to audition for as many groups as possible! This will increase your odds of finding a group you click with. For groups in acaprez, you can only take two callbacks, so if it gets to that point, you have to choose two. Good luck! :) def let me know if you have any other a cappella questions haha

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI think you would be fine. Econometrics has more to do statistics (from ECO 202) than Linear Algebra and especially Multivariable Calculus. Generally, I think a lot of ECO classes require those MAT courses to make sure you are quantitatively capable enough to handle the workload. That will be much more important than the actual content of 202.\u000aFor example, ECO 310 is a benchmark course for all upper level finance courses, despite the class not being very relevant to just about all of them.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI was kind of in a similar situation a few weeks ago. What I did, and I think what is most appropriate to do, is to ask the first internship for an extension, and then to put pressure on the second for a decision. I emailed the first employer and said something along the lines of \u201chey, thank you so much for this amazing opportunity, I\u2019m really excited for it, etc.\u201d and then that I was wondering if I could possibly have a little while longer to make a decision about the program as I needed to talk it over with my parents/get all my cards on the table/plan my summer/etc. I then emailed the second employer and explained how interested I was in their program, but how I had another offer that I needed to respond to, and was hoping for a decision soon. I got it that same day. I also had a third offer on the table, and they were very kind and were able to expedite my interview process and give me a decision before I had to respond to the first offer. \u000aEveryone in this situation was very understanding. They all have dealt with college kids and summer schedules on a regular basis, so I\u2019m sure this is not the first time they\u2019ve had a candidate with this problem. Email or call them ASAP and explain, and hopefully they\u2019ll be willing to accommodate!

Like I said in the last post you can get physics out of the way as well if you want (I kinda wish I wasn\u2019t in physics now, but it\u2019s really not that bad). Maybe take a class like cellular immunology or viruses (both upper level MOL classes that premeds are often interested in). If you want to get the english requirement out of the way, take an LA. If you haven\u2019t done the language requirement, get on that as well.

If you want to go hard on the premed requirements, you could also take physics next year, but if I were you I\u2019d probably wait to take physics until junior year with biochem. \u000aOn top of orgo/neuro, I\u2019d take another MOL class and an english class. That way you\u2019re sampling neuro, mol, and english and can hopefully get a better idea of what you want to major in.

Vr f Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000asure, though I\u2019m no pro on the field. Probably the best place to learn about this would be the Columbia website, since they have a master\u2019s program for Narrative Medicine - http://www.narrativemedicine.org/ or http://www.narrativemedicine.org/about-narrative-medicine/\u000aSome people who would fit within this category, in my opinion, would be Atul Gawande, Siddhartha Mukherjee, Dhruv Khullar, and Paul Kalanithi. All of these people write/wrote works on the practice of, development of, or experiences of medicine which the lay public can read to gain more insight into the field and get a better understanding of their situations/possible treatments. They blend patients\u2019 stories with a medical perspective to humanize the experience and make the stories more personal for the readers. Any news correspondent with an emphasis on medicine and health would probably fit in this category too - thikn Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Hope these examples give an idea - I\u2019m still figuring it out for myself. I\u2019d also suggest taking a look at the bio and project description of the person who won the Dale Award last year, since her project takes a photo-journalism approach to conveying the experiences of individuals who may lack access to quality healthcare.\u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aIf you\u2019re interested at all in this field, I would highly recommend you take Dr. Carolyn Rouse\u2019s course, Race and Medicine. It highlights the promise, as well as the limitations, of individualized health care with regards to race and ethnicity.

Vr f sf \u201816:\u000ai sat in on half the course when I was an undergrad. It was interesting, but it wasn\u2019t as good as the intro to moral philosophy course I took my freshman year. That was partly a personal opinion, because I preferred the overview of many approaches to moral theory with the few classes at the end on practical implications as opposed to Singer\u2019s review of his own theories and justifications with the occasional course that invited speakers to make it really practical and discuss how to follow through on the ethical principles he outlined. Depends on whether you are trying to learn more about the different ways to define right and wrong or about how practical issues can be considered ethically. It\u2019s not a bad course, just seemed like more of a lecture-based course than a discussion based course (but, as a disclaimer, I never attended any precepts for Singer\u2019s course)

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aThere is a shuttle that runs frequently from Lakeside/Lawrence (and other places) to most main areas on/near campus, most grad students use that to get around! Or a bike. My car is parked in Lawrence apartments, and while my dorm (Scully) is probably the closest of all dorms to Lawrence, when I walk from my dorm to Lawrence it\u2019s definitely less than 20-30 minutes, it\u2019s closer to 10-15. As far as the chances you\u2019ll get the housing that you want, none of us are grad students so I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to give you an accurate answer on that.

Focus on understanding what has been hurting you for the first half of the course and take steps to study more effectively. One incredibly important thing is to take your exams/papers that may not have been the best and go to office hours. If you haven\u2019t done well, this can feel particularly tough, but those TAs/professors want you to do well (even if some of them come off as rude lol). I\u2019ve had friends go from Bs to As in a matter of weeks in a variety of different courses, so there is always room for improvement! \u000aHang in there, friend! Just remember: NO MORE L\u2019S!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aJust as a heads up, Princeton accepts very very few students off the waitlist. The number is something like 30/yr of the 1,168 students on the waitlist. I personally don\u2019t know a single person who got in off the waitlist (although perhaps I do and they haven\u2019t said anything), but am answering just because this question has been here for a while and I have some experience with it because of giving campus tours. I think the best thing to do is to send a letter of continued interest, just saying that you\u2019re still really interested in/passionate about Princeton, and then updating them about what you\u2019re currently doing.  \u000aResponse from Ariel:\u000aOne of my roommates actually got in off the waitlist! When I talked to her about it, she said she simply kept her grades up and tried not to think about it. Demonstrating interest unfortunately doesn\u2019t do a lot, so focus on what made you stand out in the first place- my roommate continued to be passionate about dance. There\u2019s not a lot in your control, so keep your head (and your grades) up!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aThe financial aid here is amazing! I got a way better package here than I did from the other schools I was accepted to, including other Ivies. \u000aSome tour guide facts and stats:\u000a\u2022 In the Class of 2021, about 63% of students received some type of financial aid. Of those who do receive financial aid, the average annual grant was over $48,000. \u000a\u2022 All of the aid at Princeton is awarded on a no-loan basis. (!!!!) This means that over 85% of seniors graduate debt-free. \u000a\u2022 Financial aid works exactly the same for both domestic and international students. \u000a\u2022 Admissions are need-blind, and financial aid here is entirely need-based. There aren\u2019t merit scholarships. Instead all of the aid is awarded based on your family\u2019s need. \u000aThe aid here is really incredible. If your package does include work, it\u2019s usually in the form of summer income and/or an on-campus job. The summer savings amount is $1800 (? I believe) for freshmen and $2800 for upperclassmen. Most on-campus jobs are pretty chill, and pay at least $11.50 an hour, which is nice. It also will depend on your package, but usually it\u2019s not like you\u2019re working a campus job to pay something off, but rather the money you earn is yours, and you can use it to pay for your different expenses.  \u000aAlso, check this out!

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI can just speak to the COS classes; hopefully someone can add on about the ORF ones. COS 226 and 217 are probably equal in terms of work. COS 306 probably has more work than both of them \u2013 but you\u2019ll probably spend less time on it altogether. In terms of difficulty, most people find 226 easier than 217 (I found the opposite because I prefer systems). I actually think that 306 was easier than 226 and 217, but again, I prefer systems. I just found it to be a little easier to pick up basic Verilog than C or more advanced algorithms.

I haven\u2019t taken COS 217 but from what I\u2019ve heard you also need to be able to dedicate substantial time to this class. I think without COS 217 or ELE206 the schedule would be definitely busy but more manageable.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI was disappointed in it. While the professor definitely cared about her students and wanted us to learn from the class, I probably could\u2019ve gotten the same amount out of it had I just attended the first class and first precept, since it felt like we went in circles for most of the semester. I guess I should\u2019ve expected that, seeing as a significant portion of the class didn\u2019t seem to care at all about it. And while I agree with pretty much everything that the professor said, I could definitely see why someone who doesn\u2019t share all of her opinions wouldn\u2019t feel welcome speaking up with a dissenting thought. It is indeed a pretty easy class, but I don\u2019t think that my preceptor was just doling out A\u2019s for completing the memos. You had to produce something of relative quality for an A.\u000aIf that\u2019s an SA, it\u2019s definitely one that people take to fill that requirement.

Vr f sf:\u000ai have to decide by the end of the month\u000aid rather not share my stats, but I will say that i think its less about having the highest numbers possible and more about getting good enough numbers and then demonstrating dedication and excellence in areas that you are passionate about and would want to pursue in and beyond med school, as well as having a cohesive story about why that is. importantly, this could be something that is intrinsic to practicing medicine (eg, some aspect of the doctor-patient relationship like advising or establishing trust) or it could be something additional beyond just the practice of medicine that you could incorporate into your career and that a medical education would prepare you to pursue. I\u2019d spend some time thinking about these early on - especially since you will probably have less time to reflect and introspect as college gets busier. To do that, think about what aligns most with your own personal values or even your hobbies and then look into what people in the field are doing that combine those concepts with medicine. Try your hand at some projects or activities that involve that sort of work and figure out if it\u2019s for you (is it something that excites you on an intellectual level? are the questions involved or the potential impacts ones that interest you? is it something you could see yourself doing in the long term?). it\u2019s way better to think early \u201cwhat do i care about and how can I pursue that?\u201d rather than looking back later and trying to figure out how you can make a story that links all of the stuff you\u2019ve done. the latter is possible, but not really enjoyable.\u000a\u000aa few examples of some such fields (which can be combined, but also don\u2019t have to be a part of your path at all):\u000athere are a ton of options. to learn more about them, you can look into the joint degree programs that med schools have for some of these, or look up leaders in the fields to see what sort of projects and work they do. try to figure out if that sort of work aligns with your interests and work ethic. if possible, try to get involved with or even start projects in these fields and see if you like it.\u000ahope this makes up for not sharing my stats.

V@Princess Mia Grad student from COS asking about MUS again. So yeah, I've been playing piano for 10+ years, but that sounds pretty scary. The only problem with taking 105 is that it conflicts with Digital VLSI, which I was super hyped about taking (I'm interesting in comparch and stuff). I wouldn't mind taking 105, but I feel that working through this conflict would kind of suck. I guess I'll take a shot at the placement test. Would I have to email Juri Seo about that?

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aWell I\u2019m not a music major, but I know a few and have taken a fair amount of MUS courses. In my opinion the hardness of the courses really really varies. Some professors give out all A\u2019s very easily in some of the more creative courses, but I also know of a counter points course that was very very hard. It really depends on your level of theory, composing, and technical ability that often determines how hard a MUS course is (upper level).\u000aAs for professors, all of the ones I have ever had are wonderful. They are great resources of knowledge, down to earth, passionate about the students, and overall great. Some are apparently very hard graders though.

VResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000aI took it the first year it was offered. For me, it wasn\u2019t a demanding course, and I learned a lot of really practical skills that I use whenever I\u2019m analyzing data (I wowed my supervisor big time the first time I used R to make some plots). I had a background in coding but was new to R, so learning the language and process was relatively easy. All in all, I would highly suggest it (even more so than COS 126 for people who will never actually code and just want to learn how to analyze data), but I would guess that it\u2019s more demanding for people new to coding. Big Data in the ORFE department is a tough, tough class, but it introduces you to even more practical data analysis stuff and is really useful for people who want to do big data stuff.\u000aResponse from Sparverius:\u000a^ Just saying, you took it with a different prof than who currently teaches it.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aThere aren\u2019t too many advantages. I guess you\u2019d get access to the listserv and probably would be assigned an advisor in your department? Maybe you\u2019d get after hours prox access like the upperclassmen. You\u2019d also have the ability to do more advanced work as a senior, and you could probably do your IW as a sophomore. (Lol those advantages are really out of order in terms of importance but I\u2019m on my phone so sry) Although normal declaration is done through the registrars website, I\u2019d venture a guess that this would require talking to a dean or dep rep or something. I could be wrong, but it\u2019s pretty unusual and there may not be as standard of a procedure for it. https://odoc.princeton.edu/curriculum/special-academic-programs/early-concentration

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real sense of res college community, though for me at least many of my friends are from my res college/neighbor res college (Rocky and Mathey) just because you meet most people through proximity.\u000aI think yale actually focuses on creates \u201cres college communities\u201d as centers of social interaction. That\u2019s definitely not true here. I don\u2019t know about Harvard. Your social life will not revolve around your res college here\u000aResponse from Olivia Pope:\u000aI would just disagree on the point that there is no res college community. I think it is highly dependent upon the res college that you get placed into. I was in Forbes and definitely felt like Forbes had a good community of people. Being in Forbes was definitely a highlight of my Princeton experience.\u000a\u000a\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000a\u000aYeah Forbes!\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aYeah I would second Olivia. I was in Mathey, which I didn\u2019t really feel any community connection with, but my building was a bit of a cult and there was most definitely a Joline crew.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aYeah, sure! There\u2019s only one essay due shortly after break and then a book review due dean\u2019s date. The essay is around 15-20 pages, but can be on absolutely any topic (the causes of any war \u2013 I chose the current Ukrainian conflict and tbh still proud of my paper). I had a lot of fun with this one, and it being due after fall break means you have a bunch of time to work on it without too much stress. The book review, you have to pick a book related to war, and then write a review of it (you\u2019re only graded check minus, check or check plus so there\u2019s no real pressure there). It was fun \u2013 I read Ernst Junger\u2019s Storm of Steel, which is a fantastic book I would highly recommend to anyone interested in WWI, especially if you are interested in a narrative different than the normal Barbusse/Remarque/Owen/Whatever other \u201cSomme\u201d narratives of the war. There was also a midterm and a final (I think, I can\u2019t totally remember if there was a midterm to be honest). These were composed entirely of IDs, and were pretty easy in my opinion if you had done the readings. Some IDs related to the news, which you were expected to be reading. I remember a question like \u201cwhich presidential candidate do you support and why (based on foreign policy).\u201d\u000aThere were a bunch of readings, though. I don\u2019t remember it being too stressful, but there were some weeks where the was a lot.\u000aDefinitely would recommend!

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aYou can probably get in. It\u2019s a lot of work, and most kids don\u2019t do the work. I did not have a good experience. I only did 216-17, and then dropped before 218-19 (not because of grades). I thinkn you cover far too much material to actually learn anything. The lectures were almost always literally just the introduction of the book, or covering parts of the book you weren\u2019t assigned (only assigned excerpts of many books, unfortunately). It\u2019s a good class for getting the kind of cursory information that you can show off at cocktail parties (lol my mom\u2019s friends all think I\u2019m a genius now :P) but it\u2019s really not worth it as an actual introduction to the canon, in my opinion. The course is hard and there\u2019s a high workload, but it is not particularly rigorous.\u000aPS, I know Dido liked it though, so maybe she can edit this with her perspective.

There are a TON of alumni everywhere and they\u2019re all super happy and excited (and also they like interacting with current students!) There are also a lot of performances and other events going on. It\u2019s a fun time!

If you live in a room that\u2019s not a single, you could also get a roommate. A few weeks before move out, they\u2019ll send out a list with reunions room assignments. If you need to live somewhere else, then you leave your current room and move into the new room around the time of move out.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aOf the buildings you mention, 1901, Lockhart, Pyne, Foulke, and Henry are in the slums. It\u2019s just that section of residential buildings. Look at them on a map to get a sense of their respective locations. \u000aAll I remember from 1901 is how freakin thin the walls were and how it was always a mess. I really wouldn\u2019t recommend unless you\u2019re set on living in the slums and have limited options. Other friends have preferred living in Laughlin, which is slightly more removed. If you go for that, try to take a room not facing the street, since the trucks loudly dump stuff right outside in the morning. In this list, 1903 and Brown are probably the nicest, followed maybe by Cuyler and Lockhart? Pyne strikes me as kind of sad. Henry, 1901, and Foulke are all kind of on the same level (and in the same courtyard).\u000aYou should also visit them before you make a decision, rather than relying on a RTP description. Just knock on the doors of the rooms you\u2019re considering and ask if you can check out their room.

I have also never heard people joking negatively or talking secretly negative things about trans people. That being said, I have read surveys regarding trans individuals at princeton and a significant number say that they have overheard negative comments or something negative happened to them. I think this is still uncommon though based on personal experience similar to homophobia.

The Housing Office will then randomly sort frosh into the 6 res colleges and try to match you according to your preferences, however this process is far from perfect. Quads are difference from doubles just in the amount of people you are living with. If you\u2019d prefer to have more than one roommate, pref living in a quad. Also, quads tend to have a common room area would could be nice, whereas doubles don\u2019t tend to have this.

The problem is that politics is a big department and people have different interests within it, so no one can really help you here unless you give us a little more help. But if you\u2019re interested in a specific thing, you probably won\u2019t have that many classes on it anyway (ie if you\u2019re interested in China, you\u2019re gonna take politics of china no matter what we say about it), so this is a hard question to answer.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aIt is guaranteed to get into PiP if you have above a B+ in RUS 101 and are doing decently in RUS 102. It\u2019s really too bad we lost the site, as I\u2019d written a lot about Russian there. The introductory teacher of Russian (Mark Pettus) is amazing. He wrote his own textbook which you will use as well, which is significantly better than any other Russian textbook I\u2019ve seen (I had to use the old one, not his, as he hadn\u2019t published his yet, but I\u2019ve seen his and it\u2019s amazing). You will extremely enjoy his class, and PiP is great too \u2013 Peter is an amazing city, the hosts are wonderful, and you will learn a lot. The upper level Russian classes are much worse, honestly (the teacher Ksana is awful), but if you are dedicated after taking 207 you will be conversational, and can choose how to continue your studies. Russian is a great language, and I super recommend it!! You will have a fun time.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI\u2019ve never taken HIS 201, but it looks like way more of a general overview than HIS 383. I feel like there\u2019s no way you could learn everything from ancient to modern history in one semester in any great specificity. HIS 383 is a great class where you really learn a lot about one specific chunk of time. It\u2019s also American History vs. World History, so perhaps consider which you prefer. Again, I\u2019ve never taken HIS 201, but it has really mixed reviews, where I can honestly say that I really enjoyed HIS 383. Kevin Kruse is a great lecturer, and a lot of the themes are still extremely extremely relevant today, especially with everything going on politically right now. I was super interested to learn about race relations, the rise of conservatism, the expansion of the federal gov\u2019t, etc. as those things are all especially prevalent today. Personally, I\u2019d pick 383, but choose what you think you\u2019d enjoy more! I\u2019m happy to answer any more specific question you have about 383.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI think you\u2019d be fine in upper level MOL classes without having taken 214 (at least I think I would\u2019ve been fine jumping into cell dev or something without 214). This probably depends on whether you\u2019ve taken AP bio, though. I took AP bio, and MOL 214 was entirely a review for me from that. If you had AP bio and did well, just jump into the upper-level MOL course. If you haven\u2019t had AP bio, I might be a bit more weary of doing this.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aOh man there\u2019s been so many at this point. I remember this one time I kind of knew this girl and saw her looking fantastic and creating the atmosphere at one of the eating clubs.\u000aSo I was with one of my friends and was like \u201cwhat should I do? I\u2019m so captivated my her fiery personality and piercing green eyes, but I barely know her. I\u2019m thinking about making a move so how would you feel abot that if you were her?; My friend was like \u201coh man here we go again. I guess it shows confidence or whatever\u201d So I\u2019m just like \u201clemme just finish these two beers first\u201d Then right as I was finishing, she and this girl won a beer pong game and kissed. My friend told me \u201cumm I think she might be a lesbian.\u000aI decided to just go with it anyway and introduced myself in her mother tongue with \u201care you from\u2026? How cool! Which city? Things were going fine and she said \u201cyeah I thought I recognized you from somewhere\u201d Things are going great and I\u2019m making her homesick talking about how great her country is. I\u2019m about to give her a compliment when she turns to her girlfriend and passionately makes out with her shoving her tongue down her throat. Then she says \u201cI\u2019m enfatiated with her\u201d I\u2019m just standing there staring and she\u2019s just like \u201cand you were about to say?\u201d After that it was just so awkward and I suddenly had no idea what to say and was just standing there like an idiot. I couldn\u2019t even continue in her language and had to switch to English. Then my friend came back and was like \u201cI told you so. I saw the look on your face, you knew. But don\u2019t worry, better luck next time!\u201c\u000a\u000a\u000aYeah so that was probably the most notable one. Most recently, I saw this beautiful girl I knew as well from one of my classes. We were just talking and I led her to the point where I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I must tell the truth. You look great tonight especially with those heels.\u201d Then she just said \u201cyep\u201d, acted like nothing happened and asked me about an assignment due in a few days lol. Then we just stood there sipping our drinking saying nothing except talking about our class every few minutes haha. Oh man, college.

Vr from SF \u201816:\u000agreat question. I never really regretted going to Pton, though there were definitely times when I resented the experience and stress. there are some real pressure points at pton (e.g. 5 course semesters for those used to 4 courses, JP, thesis), and there are a few moments when you think to yourself \u201cwhy did I do this to myself\u201d, but you learn to adjust, and I learned that \u201cnothing worth doing is easy\u201d and I really believe that. The work results in a substantial product that either provides you with a stronger skill set or is actually valuable in the context of the academic discourse.\u000aI remember asking myself \u201cwhy didnt i apply to stanford\u201d whenever the weather was rotten at pton, but I visited the school during my senior year and realized that while the weather was way better, the school didnt really jive with me, mainly because of the large number of students and the huge size of the campus that lacked in undergraduate focus and identifiable buildings relative to Princeton\u2019s (like all the buildings look the same, so the campus seemed pretty redundant). \u000alooking back, I absolutely do not regret my decision, and I wish I had a better appreciation for the value of the work I did while there. My work ethic and the quality of my work improved dramatically at Princeton, and I think I finally got pushed outside of my comfort zone to a point where I could develop as a person and learn about what sort of work I enjoy and how to conduct it efficiently. That said, as with any demanding undergrad, students could use more time to reflect and figure out what it is that they are working towards and why they want to pursue it. I just had an interesting conversation with someone who interviewed for some big name fellowships and was surprised to find how many people from top schools applied just \u201cbecause they were qualified\u201d and not because they felt that the experience would help them get to where they wanted to be. \u000aa last piece of advice: try not to get caught up in the social hierarchies and pressures wherever you go. it\u2019ll just distract you from the relationships and activities and self-discovery that really matter and would serve you best. I\u2019ve mentioned in an earlier post that the small size of pton can kind of lend itself to those pressures, but once you check out and realize that you really won\u2019t see most of those people again (I\u2019ve already forgotten most of their names\u2026) and that the people who would really have your back or speak up for you in a professional setting are the ones who know you beyond just a formal acquaintance or who think you\u2019re an uncontroversial person, like your friends who know and like you as your own person with your unique quirks and interests.

Vr from SF \u201816:\u000atrying to decide now. it\u2019s probably the hardest decision of my life tbh. my two main options are very different educationally, culturally, geographically, and financially (and also in terms of proximity to family and other support structures), but I can\u2019t not think of what I\u2019d be missing out on and how it might be better for me if I were to turn down one of the options.\u000a\u000aopen to any advice from you guys, haha. college was a much easier decision for me because I figured all of the top schools were pretty much the same academically and I had a gut feeling when I visited pton. I applied early and that was that. med school doesn\u2019t work that way, unfortunately.

I enjoyed the class a lot, but the grading was stricter than I expected, and there was a reasonable but still existent amount of reading every week. However, Kevin Kruse is an amazing lecturer, and it is such a worthwhile class! I\u2019m happy to talk about that class more in detail if you/someone else would like. My friend told me that HA Bridges is a lowkey mess, but easy. I\u2019d go with Bridges if you legitimately don\u2019t like history or either HIS 219 or 383 if you actually do want to take a history class.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aIt was much harder than I was expecting. I had literally zero background in econ, but my personal experience with the class was that there was a huge difference in the material presented in lecture and the questions on the problem sets/tests. This gap was incredibly hard for me to bridge with no prior knowledge or understanding of the subject. I could easily follow everything brought up in lecture, but the questions on psets/tests were significantly more difficult that what we did in class. I always got at least a 9/10 on the psets, but I went to McGraw absolutely every single week, and even at McGraw, it took a combination of tutors, multiple students, and textbooks or online resources for us to come up with some type of reasonable answer. The tests were ridiculously hard. Idk to be 100% honest I\u2019m bitter af about that class lol it tanked my GPA last semester. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad class overall (I took it with Rosen), but it is not something I recommend that you take for fun or an easy A unless you understand econ really well or have taken AP Micro or something. I think it could be a good PDF if you just want to test it out. Also, I didn\u2019t take it with Farber, but he has AWFUL reviews on course offerings (like below 3/5). Look at those for more specifics. I obviously can\u2019t speak for everyone in the class (I\u2019m sure there are many people who thought it was a breeze), but I took it with a large group of friends, and our grades ranged from C- to B-, with some people PDFing it to save their GPAs, so take that for what you will.    \u000aYeah sorry this post sounds so jaded haha! I\u2019m a very nice person I promise, I just did not like that class and this is real talk lol.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aHey! Welcome! I\u2019m pretty sure that you\u2019re allowed to do this (I\u2019ve had grad students in several of my classes), but I\u2019d just send a quick email to the department and double check. MUS 205 requires at least MUS 106 as a prereq anyways, so you wouldn\u2019t be able to take it without having taken the 105-106 sequence (or getting a high grade on the placement test). Regardless, I think that MUS 105 is pretty challenging. A lot of Glee Club/orchestra/been playing piano for 10 years type kids take it and find it challenging, so I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that you can just brush over easily. It\u2019s pretty heavy and goes beyond the basics. If you think you could pass out, ask for a placement test though! The worst that could happen is you don\u2019t end up in 205.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI know nothing bout 381, but I think 206 could be a great complement to 226. 206 is Verilog, which is nothing like the coding you do in 126/226, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be at an enormous disadvantage having not done any substantial algorithms work. (It could actually help. You really have to forget how to \u201ccode like a COS major\u201d if you want to do well in 206 \u2013 it\u2019s just a very different way of thinking. You\u2019re probably not as deeply entrenched in that yet, so you might have the flexibility that it requires.) Just be warned that 206 has a crapton of work; it\u2019s one of the easier classes in our department, but you end up spending a ton of time working on psets/labs/key ideas assignments. Could be a lot with 226, which is also a bit of a time suck. Just make sure that you balance it out w some humanities and maybe a PDF course.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aYeah I think it\u2019d be a mistake. Why would you even consider it if not for money?\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI turned down the A. B. Duke scholarship to come to Princeton, and I\u2019m happy to explain my reasoning (or lack thereof). If money is not your main consideration, then maybe how I thought about this decision could be of some help?\u000aBasically, it came down to a gut feeling \u2013 Princeton felt right, it\u2019s where I had always planned on going (lol I really hadn\u2019t come up with a Plan B). I also fell even more in love with it once I visited. But more logically: I thought a lot about career options (specifically, would Princeton open up doors that Duke would not?). At the time, I thought yes. (In retrospect, I think the difference was probably minimal.) I also thought about location; I randomly happen to have a ton of family in this area, so it was really nice to be within close driving distance of my aunts, cousins, and grandparents.\u000aIf I were you, I\u2019d probably also consider the following:\u000aI think I wrote this in a post that\u2019s now deleted: if I had to make the decision again, I\u2019d think a lot harder about it, but I\u2019d still choose Princeton.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI would say probably\u2026\u000a1) The econ + stats courses. I struggled a lot in micro, but I also had never taken an economics class before, so take that for what you will. I\u2019ve heard that stats classes tend to trip people up, but to be honest, I\u2019m in a stats class right now, and I\u2019m actually really enjoying it! I thought it would be hard, but I love the professor and performed very well on the midterm\u2026 tbh one of my favorite classes this semester! \u000a2) The language classes. I love learning languages and the classes at Princeton are awesome, so this was actually a highlight of the major for me! I don\u2019t think that this requirement is well-promoted, but WWS majors are required to take either one extra language class in the language they used for the AB requirement, or two intro classes in a new language. For people who don\u2019t like languages, this can be annoying/difficult, especially as most language classes meet 3-5 days per week. One of my friends is really struggling in a 200-level language course at the moment to fulfill this requirement. But again, I\u2019ve had nothing but terrific experiences with language here. \u000a3) Task force\u2026 from what I\u2019ve heard from my older friends, it can be hard to balance task force on top of 4 other classes, and it also requires a wide skill set.\u000aOlivia Pope is also a woody woo major, so perhaps she can share her feelings as well!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aAt this point, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything you can do. We\u2019ve gotten a couple of questions like this, so just for the future, it\u2019s really important to be honest with yourself and your roommates before deciding who to draw with! Instead, the best thing that you can do right now is to prepare to live with them and do what you need to do to make that comfortable for you. Have you tried telling your roommate that they\u2019re being disruptive? Maybe just talk to them about it, and hopefully they\u2019ll change their behavior. Odds are, they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re bothering you. For example, I used to listen to music while on my computer in bed at night, and my roommate told me that is was really distracting for her, so I stopped. If you talk to them about it, hopefully they\u2019ll be more considerate! Another thing you could consider is asking the quad to change up who is living in each double. Is there another roommate who you click better with, or whose schedule aligns more closely with yours? That might be a better match. Just ask them to talk- if they really care that much about keeping the peace in the quad, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll be more than willing to accommodate some changes.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aWhen answering that type of question, my goal is never to \u201ctrick\u201d anyone into coming to Princeton. Sometimes you can look at your options, look at which school is better for your intended concentration, look at where the different schools are, visit both, and decide that you love both and could see yourself being happy at either. If that were me, I\u2019d want to hear current students\u2019 perspectives. I\u2019m pretty sure Maybach has been telling potential premeds that their lives will be easier at other schools. It\u2019s definitely not all \u201cPrinceton is perfect and you should come here\u201d (although I do think Princeton is perfect lol). What\u2019s wrong with people asking for advice from students that have been to Princeton and have insight that prefrosh can\u2019t get from looking at statistics, websites, and campus tours?\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aGuilty as charged haha. I\u2019m definitely not trying to convince people to choose Princeton at all and if you see my previous posts Nick and Harvey think I make the school seem \u201ccrummy\u201d and other negative things. If you read this blog enough, you will for sure see a diversity of experiences and opinions on this school that will help make a good decision.\u000aI actually love Princeton #iluvprinceton and have stated this in multiple posts. But the problem is that I know that my experience is not necessarily indicative of the majority of students here and backgrounds different than mine. My philosophy towards answering these questions is always to tell the pre-frosh to choose what is best for them. Part of determining this is understanding why some people at Princeton are miserable and/or unhappy and if the pre-frosh student has a high probability to end up like that as well. When I say that premeds will probably have to work harder here to get good grades, that doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t come here. It\u2019s only a factor and a valid one. A lot of people I met at Yale wanted to take it easy when they got to college so if you are a person like this then you should know that Yale may be better for you than Princeton in solely this factor. On the flip side, I want to make sure they know the best that Princeton has to offer and whether they want to take advantage of that. Princeton has a better Econ department than all the other Ivies and that should also factor into decisions. In the end you need to add all these up.

I liked Woody Woo because I felt that it was more interdisciplinary and I really loved how many different types of classes I could take for the major.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aYou mean me? hahah. Just kidding. But shoutouts to the fellow Kasich fan who just submitted a post!!!\u000aI WAS TOTALLY feeling the Kasich this year and it brings great joy to my heart to see that lol.\u000aBut yeah, one thing I don\u2019t like about Princeton is that I often times have to conceal how I really feel in order to avoid unnecessary confrontation. But it\u2019s also refreshing because I get to hear authentic viewpoints without shouting. For example, I took a race class this year and everyone in the class had a different opinion than me and it was great for me to hear their logic and reasoning. For all the pre-frosh though, Princeton is definitely less liberal than practically all the other Ivies except Dartmouth. At the Princeton Tory last year we joked that we couldn\u2019t complain about anything without sounding privileged compared to the other ivies.\u000aYes there are many super liberals, but my friends are from a wide range across the political spectrum and I find that there are many non-vocal conservatives and moderates as well. We actually have pretty good political diversity for an Ivy.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aCouldn\u2019t agree more with the above statement. I\u2019ll just also add that there are also a ton of libertarians here as well who were feeling the Johnson this year. I actually really like Princeton for have such political diversity (Yes I know it is still heavily liberal skewed). I came to college to have my ideas challenged and to hear new viewpoints. I\u2019ve been blessed to have had new experiences and meet people from very different backgrounds with very different viewpoints.\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI agree with ya, MR. And it goes both ways. I\u2019m uber uber uber uber liberal, but a lot of my friends aren\u2019t. For some anecdotal evidence, a not-insignificant portion of my eating club voted for Trump, and another not-insignificant portion identify as \u201craging feminist.\u201d It makes for interesting conversation fodder.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aI wrote \u201csocioeconomic class\u201d for the record. I would say that I just agree with other people when they talk about economic things, because I don\u2019t want to make things awkward, even if it means I kind of misrepresent myself.\u000aAn anecdote to describe this. I\u2019m in a class of 4 that meets for 3 hours once a week, and a few weeks ago there was something really awkward relating to this. A lot of time we get off topic and just kind of chat \u2013 last week we were talking together and one of the girls started talking about how expensive the school is, to which someone responded that it\u2019s actually difficult to track how much tuition has increased over the years because of the increase in financial aid that happened at the same time. This led to the another being like, you know 50% of kids pay in full, and ended with the whole class including the professor shitting on people that pay for school here, and talking about how they should be charged like a million dollars a year, and no one making under 200k a year should pay anything, and how we should let less of them in because they\u2019re probably just here for their money etc etc etc. Obviously in this situation, the only thing to do is chime in and agree, which is exactly what I did.\u000aI\u2019m not on any financial aid but they\u2019ll never know lmao I think my grade would drop three letters from the sheer hatred of my commie prof\u000aAlso in general if people are complaining about money problems and I feel like the thing expected is commiseration, I\u2019ll do that. If it seems like I should match their anecdotes with my own, I\u2019ll do that too, even if it means I am mildly creative and not entirely truthful. I have totally pretended to be filling out my FAFSA before lol. This is mostly for my not super good friends though; I try not to talk about money anyway it\u2019s just not a subject I think you should talk about\u000aPS: I know this is a different perspective from a lot of the people on here, but I wanted to share it, because I know there must be some people reading here who relate to it

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI agree\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aOk fair enough, everyone is entitled to their opinion so I edited the previous post. That being said, Princeton does not publish statistics from surveys regarding this precise type of information so I can only speak to my personal experience.\u000aAll I can say is that my friends and the clubs I\u2019m in generally have a great deal of racial and economic diversity. I also know several students who break traditional stereotypes regarding groups/clubs that are known to be exclusive. For example, I think Ivy gets a bad rep for being elitist with not enough diversity. However, I personally know two people of color who are not rich in their opinion who are members. Also keep in mind that Princeton has been greatly increasing economic diversity with grants over the past few years and only admits about 10% legacy students each year.\u000aResponse from Winnie P:\u000aI just want to add that I think the vast majority of my friends are from a different socioeconomic class than me and it has never caused us any friend problems, and I don\u2019t know anyone who actually would choose their friends in this way\u000aeven though on further thought tbh sometimes I lie about my socioeconomic class actually, or more like, misrepresent it, so maybe this was a bit of a lie\u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aJust another quick account on socioeconomic status!\u000aSo, when I think of my close friends, I think they really all run the spectrum in terms of socioeconomic status. To be frank, I don\u2019t think socioeconomic status has ever come up in almost any interaction between me and someone else unless he/she is particularly shallow about it (which is gross in general and lol bye). Like everyone else has said, this is purely my personal experience.\u000aThat being said, I definitely understand how people here may feel the effects of socioeconomic separation. It can be little things that add up - maybe people talk about certain costs like they\u2019re nothing when, to someone else, they can be substantial. Some might say that our social culture is based around eating clubs which, to some, are simply financially exclusive. These situations might come down to economic decisions - why spend money on this when you could save it and help out back home or put it toward something else. Still, there is so much community on campus that focuses on these exact sentiments and on bringing together people feeling similar struggles - at least I think so.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aNote. this is also answering the other similar question in the inbox regarding social atmosphere/vibe. \u000aI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say that we have an elitist element here at Princeton. People tend to separate themselves based on socio-economic status.  However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as strong as Yale or Harvard\u2019s and this is only a weak association (in my own personal opinion). All of my friends come from diverse backgrounds and walks of life from very rich to well below median income in this country. Harvard for sure has even more trust fund babies and an even stronger legacy effect, and political influence than Princeton. This includes Yale and goes much further than the Bushs, De Blasio, etc. Yale\u2019s secret societies are even more exclusive than eating clubs and more elitist. A bunch of Harvard\u2019s finals clubs segregate based on gender, unlike our eating clubs. Furthermore, at our eating clubs, tons of non-affiliated people who don\u2019t fit the elitist stereotype apply and get in.\u000aWith regards to partying and drinking, keep in mind that only 50% of our students are even in an eating club. A substantial group of people here have friends and a vibrant social life that does not include an aspect of partying and/or anything elitist related. I would also note that the pressure to drink at Princeton is for sure lower than Yale\u2019s and Harvard\u2019s. I know plenty of dry people who go out and have fun and are never looked down upon for their choice. People are very very very rarely going to act snide about this.  I also know plenty of people who never go out and find others like them who just enjoy watching movies, playing cards, and talking late at night.

VResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000aPBK is awarded to the top 1% of the class either after Junior year or Senior Fall, and then the top 10% are inducted after Senior Spring (including thesis grade). It\u2019s all numbers-based, I believe, and has nothing to do with who knows whom. There\u2019s no way to know the cutoff - it varies each year, but I would guess around 3.85 or so for the top 10%, and if your friend\u2019s GPA is that high, the cutoff for the top 1% is probably >3.95 in general. I would bet that your friend will get inducted at the end of the year.

I found that once I became more serious in my pursuit of guys (post frosh week lol), I met guys who were looking for something serious too. That being said I came from a high school w a strong hookup culture so maybe I\u2019m just drawing a comparison\u2026\u000aIn general, I feel like college lends itself to hookup culture because it is more convenient\u2026people are more focused on academics than investing in a relationship on a serious level. However there are definitely guys looking for what you are looking for on campus!\u000aResposne from Maybach Renntech:\u000aHaha, I\u2019m definitely one of those guys who is NOT AT all interested in hookups and have been looking for a serious relationship for a while now.

I was one of the original founders of the site way back when I was a soph, and I\u2019ve been so, so bummed that we lost all of our work and everything we produced that could potentially be used in the future and could serve as a sort of snapshot of Princeton, but this may just change the game. We\u2019ve recently been considering revamping the entire program to make it its own site/app, and we might just be able to salvage all of our old data now. You are a true hero!!

VResponse from Bateman: pretty normal to be feeling this way (same here). I mean..you could try career services and have your own opinion? Might be helpful to share what year you are, what you\u2019re studying, etc. Idk how people know what they want to do so early on..and it usually changes anyways. \u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000aI like talking to my parents about it, they\u2019re very helpful at letting me air these frustrations and give me great life advice (i know not everyone may feel this way about theirs)\u000aResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000aThis is not uncommon, and I had my own \u201cmid-college crisis\u201d (nice term!). Something that happens at many, if not all, of the most demanding universities is that students have little time for reflection or to go out on a limb and try something new and unconventional for the path they\u2019ve been on. I think this is especially true because a lot of times, students have been following a predefined path for a long time and perhaps realize that the end goal (be it the work, the impact, or the work/life balance) doesn\u2019t quite align with their interests/passions. However, you still have a lot of time to figure this out. I\u2019m wrapping up the med school interview cycle now, and I\u2019m seeing people interviewing for med school with me who are late 20\u2032s/early 30\u2032s and have already had impressive and interesting careers doing things like writing books, teaching, traveling, doing research, etc. To be honest, it kind of made me wish I had taken more than one year off to try other things before jumping into the medical world - that\u2019s how fulfilled and driven these people seemed. Princeton has a number of programs for grads to travel and do service projects like teaching all over the world (e.g., Princeton in Asia, Princeton in Latin America, Project 55, the Dale, the Labouisse, and there are a ton of other fellowship opportunities too!). Those are just a few options of how to explore other options or confirm a career interest before committing. If I were in your position, I would try to get a sense of what different careers are like, first by Googling, and then by talking to other students who are on those paths. I remember asking many people questions like \u201cWhat is consulting exactly? So what is an example of what you\u2019d do?\u201d or \u201cWhy do you like X? What excites you about it?\u201d or \u201cDo you worry that programming might be too limiting in terms of job opportunities or would involve a lot of grinding for a long time?\u201d. You may find a lot of people in a similar position to you, and a lot of people who are pretty confident in their paths, and I think that either one is fine and normal at your stage. Through these conversations, I think you\u2019ll start to imagine yourself in these careers and identify some that, when you imagine them, you see yourself constantly excited and interested, at least about part of the role. It could be the questions you ask or the work you\u2019d do to answer them or the people you\u2019d interact with or some other component of the job. One last thing: you may not have a sense of what drives you or what sort of questions are energizing and interesting to you (which is also ok!), and this is something that I think you\u2019ll discover over time as you continue to do your schoolwork, summer projects, and independent work (for me, I learned A TON about myself through my thesis and even more through my internship this year). In other words, give yourself the time to figure it out, but also push yourself to learn more about other options and maybe even try some out.\u000a Sorry for the essay, but I hope I helped!!

VResponse from Bateman:\u000aI dunno I guess it depends on what kind of social scene you\u2019re looking for. To me, it sucks that we don\u2019t have a bar scene/the eating clubs play such an important part at the school. Also would rather not be living in dorms after freshman year. If you\u2019re into that though, it can be great, and most people are fans of it\u000aIf you\u2019re not into going out/that sort of thing, you would also find that the school is very accommodating, so there\u2019s that. If you have any specific questions thatd probably be more helpful\u000a\u000aResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000aBest - for me, it\u2019s a split between 1) the nights on the street with my group of friends where we\u2019re really not caring about the other people on the street and just doing our thing/enjoying a band that just hits the spot at Terrace and 2) nights in with my buddies, usually after planning to go out but then being like \u201cnah not worth it, we\u2019re all together already and having more fun here anyway\u201d. The dorms can do a GREAT job of bringing people together and fostering friendships that last all four years, or at least until people split off into eating clubs. I loved meeting other Princeton students, most of whom can engage in interesting, educational, and challenging conversations about almost anything. After leaving, I\u2019ve realized that those sorts of interactions are not as easy to find off campus as they were on campus.\u000aWorst - Pton (the school) is pretty small and can get to feel pretty stifling. It\u2019s not that you know everyone, but it\u2019s more like you are surrounded by familiar faces (lots of the same people in the same places), which can evoke some odd feelings of being watched or judged. There\u2019s a good deal of clique-iness and exclusivity, often from a sort of social-climbing atmosphere and a kind of \u201cpopularity\u201d culture similar to the typical high school\u2019s and not necessarily coming from the eating clubs (though the groups often arise within the eating clubs and the exclusivity could come from the fact that the members have the opportunity to interact and bond way more than with non-members, so their group becomes pretty solidified in that way). The eating clubs can be positive environments for people to meet and become friends, but the same issues of social hierarchies also often arise within the eating clubs as well. The thing is that these sorts of issues occur in any social sphere, so it\u2019s not like you won\u2019t find it, at least to some degree, at other institutions.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aNot ideal, but one of my best friends is in cell dev, genetics, and orgo right now. She seems to be surviving. Cell dev really isn\u2019t bad, genetics is a pset each week, and physics is 2 mini-psets per week (at least that what it is for 108). I think it\u2019s doable. \u000a\u000aResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000aI agree. Cell Dev is like high school bio, lots of memorization and textbook diagrams to make sense of and move on. The biggest determinant of your semester will be physics, since there\u2019s a big difference in difficulty level between 102 and 104, especially if you\u2019ve already taken physics in high school (in which case, 102 is more of a passive class where you have to just review and go to lab and do the assignments). Genetics is a pretty technical and time-consuming course, but it\u2019s also doable if you put in the time (to get the concepts down) and work with preceptors and classmates to make sure you have the psets down. At least when I took it, the exams were basically the same as the psets, so you can like memorize the psets and do really well on the exams.

VResponse from Ziggy: \u000aWhat do you mean by \u201ccatch up\u201d? You\u2019re not behind as a freshman in the spring taking 126. People don\u2019t need to take 226 with 217 unless there\u2019s a chance that they won\u2019t finish both by the end of sophomore year. We only take 8 other departmentals, and it\u2019s typical to do 2 per semester junior and senior year. Also, 226 and 217 are significantly more demanding than 126; you should avoid taking them together unless you\u2019re positive you\u2019ll succeed doing it\u2026

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aNo, but I know multiple people who have taken gen chem over the summer. Assuming you\u2019re premed, I think it\u2019s less advisable then actually taking the course at Princeton, but contact HPA to make sure that it\u2019s okay for you to do that for med school. From my friends\u2019 experiences, the pros were that it was much easier at smaller/local schools and that you got extra course credits for doing it, and the cons were that it was expensive, and they had to sit through chem during their summers and couldn\u2019t really do an internship or anything. Also your grade from the class doesn\u2019t impact your GPA here (as many of my friends with As were very disappointed to find out!). \u000aResponse from Sparverius:\u000aAbout that last point: I\u2019m pretty sure that any course you\u2019ve taken at a college has to be reported on the AMCAS, and factors into the GPA that\u2019s reported to med schools, even if it\u2019s not part of your Princeton GPA.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aSorry for the delay in answering this. I ended up going out last night instead of studying lol. I love the MOL department. I can\u2019t really imagine myself in any other department, except maybe neuro, and I don\u2019t find too many of the neuro departmentals to be that interesting. The faculty are generally good. The classes are tough (biochem, genetics, core lab were all a struggle). JPs aren\u2019t bad. We have 2 in the fall which are critical analyses of a scientific paper. They\u2019re about 7 pages each and can be cranked out in a day or 2. We have 1 spring JP which is basically a thesis proposal. We have to give a lit review/background on our project, identify specific aims for the project, and then write out an experimental design for the research. It\u2019s due May 9th, so not anytime soon.\u000aSome complaints I have about the MOL department:\u000a-one of the genetics profs made the class unnecessarily difficult when I took it, but he\u2019s gone now so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem anymore.\u000a-some people get fucked over when it comes time for thesis advisor selection (didn\u2019t happen to me; I got my first choice advisor, but it definitely happened to some others).\u000a-I think the cell dev profs are horrible\u000a-you now have to take SML 201 (this is a new requirement that took effect the year after I became a freshman, so I don\u2019t have to take it). It\u2019s a statistics/coding class, and I absolutely hate coding, so I know I\u2019d struggle very much.\u000aSome things I particularly like about the MOL department:\u000a-huge overlap with premed requirements. If you\u2019re MOL, you\u2019ve basically done everything you need to go to med school.\u000a-lots of freedom in departmentals (even though 4 core ones are chosen for you: core lab, genetics, cell dev, and biochem). The other 4 can be anything (including 300 level EEB courses, lots of CBE classes). Also, orgo 1 and 2 count as departmentals. It\u2019s not a hard major to finish all the requirements.\u000a-the profs are doing dope research (my thesis is on virus-host interactions, characterizing the interactions between HCMV and host cell proteins and organelles during infection)\u000a-the junior tutorials really make you better at reading and criticizing the primary literature\u000a\u000a-really good course offerings in my opinion \u2013 psychopharmacology, molecular basis of cancer, viruses, cellular immunology, cellular neurobiology\u2026 The list goes on but those are just a few that I\u2019ve taken / want to take next year! \u000a\u000a\u000aIf you have more specific questions, send em into the inbox! Happy to answer anything about MOL, premed, JPs, etc!

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aMine was 3 and a half pages single spaced. I basically talked about everything that got me to where I am today. I wrote about how my dad\u2019s in the military, so I had to move around a lot as a kid. I talked about triathlons. Talked about how I came into princeton thinking I wanted to get my PhD and how that changed to me being premed through a variety of experiences. I kinda framed it so that my resilience, passion, and goal-oriented mindset really showed through. \u000aI don\u2019t think the specifics of what you write matter. Tell Kate how you got to where you\u2019re at. What qualities / experiences will make you a good doctor?

I think if you know how to code in R, the basic MATLAB stuff you need to know for 363 should come easier and you should have that \u201cfamiliarity with MATLAB\u201d that they \u201crequire\u201d. I think Edamame said in an earlier post that you just need to know basic syntax and then the rest they teach you in 363.

VResponse from Olivia Pope:\u000aWhere are you interning for the summer? Last year I did an internship in NYC through the Pace Center and lived in an NYU dorm, which was a pretty straightforward and stress-free way to find housing in NYC. I then just took the subway or walked to work. Housing during the summer in NYC in an NYU dorm (w/o A/C) was ~$3000 which is a lot but it was all covered by the Pace Center. If you could provide more city-specific context we might be able to provide more relevant information.\u000aHere\u2019s a guide that PICS gives to their interns to find housing:\u000ahttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1XftWsO96riGU6VbXMEXFp9Y-1p4zF\u20137ymFUW_jV9qg/edit\u000aHere\u2019s more information about nyc dorm housing:\u000ahttp://www.nyu.edu/summer/housing/http://www.newschool.edu/student-housing/summer/http://housing.columbia.edu/intern-summer-housinghttp://www.sva.edu/students/housing/summerhousing/intern-visiting-student-summer-housing\u000aHere\u2019s Facebook groups to find a sublet/other good housing options (in nyc):\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/groups/214004715381479/https://www.facebook.com/groups/305280662822489/https://www.facebook.com/groups/apartmentsnyc/members/https://www.facebook.com/groups/838592299562056/\u000a\u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000aHere\u2019s my experience w housing when I did IIP last summer in China. Mine was in 2 different cities in China, 4 weeks in Shanghai and 4 in Beijing. SH was first and I used Airbnb, found a decent-looking place that if I stayed in it for the full 8 weeks, it would have like just been within budget of the funding that IIP gave I think. In reality it was not as good as it looked, but livable, hosts were nice. Used the subway at first, it was quite cheap (like ~50 cents USD per ride), but then started using Uber to and from work cuz it\u2019s quite cheap in China (about $2 USD per ride), and I would get a lot less sweaty!\u000aWhen I went to Beijing I decided I wanted a nicer place so I didn\u2019t use Airbnb, and found a nice service apartment in a great location that was waaaaay over budget. So to answer the last question you asked, how I got over it after paying a fortune, I just made the most of the dope place I was staying at! I had people over for parties a lot, explored the beautiful area, and went out a lot and enjoyed my time! It was nice cuz they had a cleaning service everyday so I could trash the room and hold parties and it would all be clean tha next day (tbt the night we went to Spark). Things like IIP and PICS give pretty shitty funding so you could try to stay within budget and have a terrible summer, or just forget about it.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aThis is realtalkprinceton, so I\u2019m going to be honest and say that Yale will definitely make the premed experience easier. I didn\u2019t apply, but lived close to the CT border and visited people there a lot.\u000aLet\u2019s see things for what they are. The average GPA at Pton is now about a 3.4, but that\u2019s pulled way up by humanities, while at Yale it\u2019s about 3.6 for all departments. Sciences at Yale are known to be easier as well. In my personal opinion, stress levels at Princeton are generally worse than at Yale and our seniors are for sure not relaxing as our New Haven peers due to the thesis.\u000aBut in the end, it really matters where you would be happiest. New Haven is really not a nice area (campus is beautiful though). Yale has a different social scene (secret societies and better residential college system), better off campus dining, and an overall different atmosphere. Princeton is very suburban and we have less undergraduate students than Yale and even less graduates, so you would get in my opinion more attention academically. Although the sense of community is still very strong at Yale, partially due to the res college system. I could go on and on with regards to differences, but the best way to know for yourself is to visit the campuses and/or have in-depth conversations with real students (WHO AREN\u2019T TOUR GUIDES).\u000aThink very carefully about your goals and try to balance them with your interests and personal preferences. The two schools are very similar in terms of academic quality, diversity, and opportunities after graduation. The choice really comes down to which environment would make you happier, while also allowing you to attain your goals. Princeton could be the better choice if the social scene, campus, etc.  suite you, but not if you end up working yourself to death in the natural sciences just to have a chance at med school and don\u2019t have the time to pursue our great non-academic opportunities.\u000aResponse from Harvey: yea you should definitely think about which school would fit you best in terms of goals - but you also kind of made princeton seem cruddy which it most definitely is not!!\u000ayes, pre-med might be slightly disadvantaged here in terms of GPA control since classes here might be harder, but many pre-med students are thriving (aka some of my friends and look at nick!!! who is succeeding both in and out of the classroom). also the more i eat out on nassau the more i realize there are still so many restaurants and good places to eat where i didn\u2019t know before. i haven\u2019t felt a lot of stress since freshman year after learning from my mistakes and adapting. i personally think if you\u2019re able to learn how to learn which is what princeton tries to help you do, you will succeed in your endeavors. but also yes definitely talk to actual students you may know!! they will give you a more realistic view #iluvprinceton\u000a\u000aResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000aSo I think princeton gpa\u2019s are kind of considered a bit more leniently than those of other schools when it comes to med school applications. The biggest difference, I would say, is that Yale students have much easier access to hospitals and medical school-level/-type research, which are helpful for medical school applications. \u000aA huge piece of advice that I want to give (and that is relevant at any undergrad) is that you should try to get in the hospital early in your undergrad career so that you can have a better sense of what it is about medicine that draws you. Don\u2019t wait to the last minute, and don\u2019t just get in the hospital for a short period either. If I went back, I would have spent the summer after my first year of college doing something more clinical and that had me working with patients more, whether as a scribe or a volunteer domestically, or working in a clinic abroad. Find a premed upperclassman who did something that sounds interesting to you and ask them for advice on how they found it and how they got the position. Good luck!

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aIf you don\u2019t feel like you really jive w your roommates / their friends, that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t feel like you gotta be best buds w them. My room freshman year was kinda just a random group of guys put together and each guy hung out w the rest of the room to varying degrees. One guy was literally never in the room and we never saw him ever, basically. We were fine with him not hanging out with us, and I think he was fine with us doing stuff without him.\u000aAnd if you say you\u2019re \u201cjust there with nobody else,\u201d does that mean you don\u2019t think your friends wouldn\u2019t really get along w your roommates so you don\u2019t bring them, or that you don\u2019t feel like you have anyone to hang out with other than your roommates? If the latter, I can just recommend doing more activities or hanging out w people in your current activities / classes (I\u2019m sure you have some acquaintances right), and trying to hang out more w the people you do get along with the most and meeting their friends. I would say most of my friends now are people who I\u2019ve met through being introduced by others (or in some cases, they\u2019re a complete stranger who friended me on facebook and who also reads rtp, shout out to you!)

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aORFE recently changed the requirements so that you don\u2019t have to take a 300-level math class. But I\u2019ll help you decide on math courses if you do want to take them.\u000aBy MAT 301 I believe you mean MAE 305/MAT 391 (math website says MAT 301 for some reason, must have been an old course number). That\u2019s what most ORFE majors take because it\u2019s pretty easy / the easiest, edamame\u2019s in it right now he could talk more about it. i was in it for a few weeks last year it was pretty boring and not worth it and my 6th class so i dropped it.\u000aMAT 320 is pretty bad. don\u2019t take it. (i took it). MAT 378 I also took, and it\u2019s really quite interesting, and while it does involve \u201cproofs\u201d it\u2019s not really the typical types of proofs in hardcore math classes. Game theory is kinda different from regular math, the class is sometimes all about being like really tedious, unlike other math classes where the material is just hard to understand (some of the stuff is hard to understand too, just not as much as some stuff in like MAT 320 or something). So I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re \u201ccrazy\u201d. There are definitely non-math majors who took it last year, a few ORFE and econ people. The professor is a really nice guy too, he\u2019s super willing to help students after class and in office hours even if you think you\u2019re really behind/not getting it, as it is rather hard for non-math majors sometimes

VResponse from Bateman: give us more info lol what are you interested in, what\u2019s important to you in a school, etc. or better just ask us specific questions about princeton\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aCongrats on getting in! It\u2019s great to have options and a payoff for all that hard work, but at the same time, I understand that making up your mind is one of the few downsides.\u000aI actually have a cousin (and best friend) who\u2019s the same year as me and at Penn right now and I visit a lot, so I feel like I have a pretty good basis for comparison. For me, I would definitely have chosen Princeton over Wharton if I had the choice again. Penn is a very pre-professional school like Cornell and not nearly as \u201cliberal artsy\u201d as Princeton. They have things like Wharton and the Nursing School. Even their Arts and Sciences program is not as diverse as Princeton\u2019s. So let that factor into your decision. This is obvious a personal preference as someone who is dead centered on finance is not going to be amused by having to take a class on ethics for example. For me, I really wanted to explore a wide variety of intellectual interests and feel that Princeton does that better as I get to Major in Econ, yet also pursue certificates in Music and Languages. Compared to my cousin\u2019s Econ major, I have less departmental requirements so that I can pursue other things.\u000aEnvironment is another big factor. How do you feel about suburbia? Because that\u2019s exactly what Princeton is and I love it. However, some people may feel that is boring and too similar to home. Penn is obviously an urban campus in Phillie with both the disadvantages and advantages of a large city. And tbh, (hope not to offend any people from the city), I\u2019m not really a huge fan of modern Phillie and Penn\u2019s campus. It\u2019s big, dirtier, and more run down. Most students at Penn move off campus for housing later in their careers, which is the opposite of Princeton where practically all housing and activity is concentrated on campus. That being said, the food\u2019s way better though if that means anything. Both campuses are about the same distance from NYC so that won\u2019t change anything. Another factor of the environment is that Penn is also a pretty big school at a little less than 10k undergraduates with a heck ton more of graduates than Princeton. That means less personal attention, larger classes, and that you really have to put yourself out there to find friends and join clubs. Partying is way bigger at Penn too with more frat presence and more pressure to drink. So once again, this depends on your personal preferences. If you love partying, Penn might be better. Just watch I\u2019m Smacked UPenn and you\u2019ll see what I mean. (that type of stuff is way less common at Princeton).\u000aAs for difficulty, it depends on the major, but Penn and Princeton are similar in difficulty. Although we do have the thesis and JP\u2019s, which are a royal pain. Our calendar is garbage too. But those are less important factors.\u000aAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t go wrong with either though. You just have to aggregate your personal preferences and match them with your goals as well. I love Princeton and would make the same choice as I did two years ago. But, my cousin loves Penn and it\u2019s a great school as well.

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aSome majors have more freedom in their classes than others, so COS there are a lot of different paths to take so they might not have a sample schedule cuz there\u2019s no typical path. Just look at the requirements and then the course offerings on the registrar to imagine a schedule. Most COS majors take 126 freshman year and then 226, 217, 340 by the end of sophomore year or junior fall, and then a bunch of 300 and 400 level courses of their own interest the rest of the time until they fill up the requirements.\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aThis is what I did. Since I\u2019m going to be a product manager, I took every chance that I could to do product- and user-centered work. So I stayed away from a lot of the traditional COS courses and focused all of my independent work (and a lot of my final projects in courses) on things that deal with HCI, end users, beta testing, UX, data, and other product skills.\u000aFrosh Fall - 126Frosh Spring - 226Soph Fall - 217Soph Spring - 435Junior Fall - 375, 597B (I think it\u2019s 516 now), IW #1Junior Spring - 333, 448, IW #2Senior Fall - 340, 306, Thesis Senior Spring - 301, 352, Thesis\u000aMy theories were 597 and 340; my apps were 435 and 301; and my systems were 375 and 306.

No shame in that; I\u2019ve been doing that a lot this year. I personally think it\u2019s fine to ask around though, as long as you\u2019re not being too obnoxious. \u000aResponse from Harvey: tru alc is expensive and it adds up, but if you\u2019re inviting friends over and they drink it, you could def. ask them to cover a bit like $2-$5 depending on how much you bought/they drink - and to echo mia, go with friends and find random pregames to get some alc before going out. and this won\u2019t even be a concern by your soph year

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aIf the only reason you\u2019d consider breaking up w her is because y'all won\u2019t be at the same school, you should give it more thought. I think that a balanced approach is best: if you\u2019re in a serious relationship going into college, you can absolutely try to make it work \u2013 but you should also be realistic and recognize that it\u2019s tough to make any LDR work out long-term.\u000a\u000a\u000aResponse from Amygdala:\u000aIf you\u2019re even asking this question, then yes. Do not try to do an LDR without 100% commitment from both sides. It will not work. Source: have spent a total of 3 years of my life in some form of LDR\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aIunno I was in a transatlantic LDR for a pretty long time and we definitely spent a while beforehand questioning whether it was going to work out. I think it\u2019s natural to be worried about it, and that worry isn\u2019t necessarily a sign in and of itself that you should break it off.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re an underclassman right? Things will change as you get into smaller seminars and more intimate classes further in your career. I think you will see that the grading is both easier and more indicative of your knowledge of the course.\u000aIntro level science, math, and economics courses are really not the best taste of the Princeton academic experience.\u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000aI think for easy exams where the average is very high, you\u2019re most likely gonna not score in the top portion because you miss some details and make smaller mistakes that add up. For harder exams where the average is low, I think the concepts are harder and so few people really have a good grasp on the material and so the averages are lower, and you score below the average just cuz you know it less well. They\u2019re two different kinds of tests that you have to prepare and adjust differently for. I have more trouble with the first type. You have to be really anal to yourself and just study harder, don\u2019t get discouraged by grades cuz grades r stupid\u000aResponse from Harvey:\u000aagreed w pichu but I prefer the first scenario because I at least understand the material - i have a fighting chance. for classes where i just don\u2019t understand, it feels terrible

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aLol tbh everyone at Princeton is at least a little bit of a nerd. I\u2019m totally sure which angle you\u2019re asking the question from, so I\u2019ll answer both ways. So if you\u2019re a prefrosh who (like I was), is worried that everyone here is really weird and only wants to study all the time, that is definitely not the case at all. I actually really really appreciate the fact that I\u2019m able to have very serious, intellectual conversations and go out and have a lot of fun with the same people. Everyone here is smart and talented and passionate about something, which is super refreshing and awesome, but most people are still at least somewhat social. Not everyone is a party animal, but most people are at least nice and approachable. I guess if you think about it, everyone here had to get through an alumni interview, so if someone was really really weird, they probably would have had a hard time with that. If you are looking to find a culture of \u201cnerds\u201d to join, I don\u2019t think you would have a hard time with that either. There are people here who study a lot or play video games, and there are also people who don\u2019t. You will find people who are like you in that regard. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that everyone here is probably a nerd at heart, but I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s an overwhelmingly pervasive \u201cnerd culture\u201d. You can easily find people that you\u2019re comfortable with, whether they\u2019re nerds or the opposite (but I would say that most people are somewhere in the middle). Sorry if this answer made no sense haha. \u000aResponse from Harvey: was also (pleasantly) surprised by how many \u201cun-nerdy\u201d people there were but everyone here is low-key nerdy to varying degrees

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aIt\u2019s really chill. You make an appointment online and can usually get one like 2 weeks out. Once you\u2019re there, you literally just pee in a cup and do the optional HIV finger prick. (Results of the blood test come back immediately.) You pay on your way out. (I think it\u2019s $14?) I\u2019m not sure about whether you can pay in cash \u2013 call them in advance to find out. But you should also ask what it comes up as on your bill, because I know that you can just charge it. (I\u2019d assume it just comes up as a McCosh visit; they have no reason to disincentivize people from getting tested\u2026 Could always tell the rents that you had a really bad cold and decided to get it checked out.) All in all, the whole procedure takes like 15 minutes and is super painless. Truly nothing to worry about \u2013 and a really smart/important thing to do!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aRight now, the building with the singles only houses women, although I don\u2019t know if that will change with the new housing policy. The two good things about that building, other than it being all singles, are that it has a great location, and a lot of the rooms are pretty big (150-160 sq feet). They also have big closets, which is cool! Inside, it\u2019s not renovated, so it doesn\u2019t look nice and new like the rest of Butler. It\u2019s just a little darker/dingier, and the rooms have tile instead of hardwood. There\u2019s also no AC. Another big drawback is that the bathrooms and laundry are in the basement, so if you live on the second floor, you\u2019ll have to walk down a few flights of stairs to use the bathroom. If you haven\u2019t chosen your room yet, I\u2019ll warn you that if you choose a room on the first floor facing out towards Bloomberg, food trucks drive by there to Wu every morning, which are really noisy and can wake you up easily. It\u2019s not a bad place to live though! Just different from the rest of Butler.

VResponse from Maybach RenntechL\u000aChillax about Preview guys. Nobody is going to remember the people they meet nor will they probably ever hang out with them again. Nothing major is going to happen that will define your Princeton experience forever and/or have major effects. Tbh, it makes me laugh reading things like \u201cdo people hook up at preview\u201d lol.\u000aUse the opportunity to decide if Princeton is right for you. You don\u2019t need to hang out with a bunch of other people unless you feel that will help you get a better feel for the campus and university. Also, if you are really that afraid of walking around alone (which you shouldn\u2019t), you could ask your preview host to talk to you and take you places. I did it last year, and I\u2019m sure whoever is your host would be happy to help you out if they\u2019re not busy at that particular moment.\u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aHaha, I see the people I met at Preview all the time and it\u2019s always funny to remember where we met. I also met some other people and now I have friends at Yale (lol). Don\u2019t make plans to meet up with other prefrosh but you\u2019re all super cool so you will organically meet one another. There are also a ton of fun events that I definitely recommend you check out! Just come ready to meet current students, meet prospective students, and have a blast. Wow, maybe some of us will even host you guys?

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aSorry you feel this way. I personally enjoy the unique aspects of forbes. Close to the train station and wawa for those late night snacks. It\u2019s quiet at night for sleeping and studying because there are no pregames or parties like at butler or whitman for example. The small size and seclusion makes for a close and friendly tight knit group of students.\u000aThe only negative is the distance, which is greatly neutralized with a bike. Also you only have to deal with forbes for two years, so look on the bright side.

VResponse from Ariel:\u000aPreview was the determining factor for me! I had all my college overnights in one week (do not suggest) and I think spending a full day on campus with future classmates was the only was for me to determine whether this was the right school for me or not. That being said, it sounds pretty pricey for you to attend! If Princeton is your number one and you feel confident in that choice, I say don\u2019t waste the money. But if you are really up in the air and have the means to visit there\u2019s no better experience than actually being here. Feel free to come at any point though as you can always get the campus vibe, not just during preview.

BUT I did call housing services right after and the most wonderful woman went in and reopened my account bless her soul and helped me select the room I wanted. \u000aBasically, what you should do (and what I didn\u2019t do) is accept terms and agreements, select each person\u2019s name that has chosen you as proxy and group their names together if they will be sharing a room, then select a room. They may also ask you to choose a meal plan which is what tripped me up. And whatever you do, do NOT refresh the page or try to go back.

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aIdk how many is what you consider \u201cmany,\u201d but my high school class size was about 95, and 4 of us came here which is unusually a lot for my high school for coming to pton. I know one of them seems to be an avid reader of RTP (hello!). The 4 of us were not really that close with one another in HS and do not really hang out that much here. Since you don\u2019t seem too excited about these other people from your HS being accepted, I don\u2019t think you are super close with them, but Princeton is bigger than your high school, like the first few days/weeks on campus you may find yourself hanging out with them sometimes just cuz you don\u2019t know anyone else here but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make other friends. Right when you get to campus you\u2019ll be introduced to people you don\u2019t know like your zee group and OA/CA (you probably don\u2019t know what those are, they\u2019re useful things for making friends, just trust me). Having people from my high school here is actually kind of nice sometimes, cuz even though we don\u2019t hang out much, when I see them and chat with them it\u2019s kinda a nice reminder of home. I think it\u2019s certainly possible to reinvent yourself even with people from your high school here, you really don\u2019t have to interact with them ever if you don\u2019t want to

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aHey, fellow vegetarian! I felt that way a lot my freshman year, so it definitely took awhile for me to figure out how to eat right. I\u2019m actually trying to go vegan at the moment, but it\u2019s proving to be way harder than I thought haha. This is going to be one of my classic really long posts, just a warning, but my number one tip to you is to check out the menus online or on the new app TigerMenus before picking a dining hall. That way, you\u2019ll have a good idea of if there is something you can eat before going for a meal. Also, in my experience, Forbes and Roma sometimes have the best vegetarian entrees, but Butler has the best options. I\u2019m going to write out what I like to eat in all the dining halls! * is something they have most days or every day. \u000aWucox: Pasta Bar* (pro tip- if you bring a plate to the salad bar, you can put veggies or tofu on it and bring it over to the pasta station, and they\u2019ll add those! you can also ask for only one or two scoops of pasta to prevent it from being too carby and less broth or sauce if you\u2019re concerned about oil. definitely add chickpeas or quinoa for protein!), Salad from the salad bar, usually with brown rice on the side*, Taco salad* (they\u2019ve been having an enchilada bar a lot of the time now, so I\u2019ll start a plate with romaine lettuce, and then add veggies and beans and brown rice with guac and mango salsa), minestrone soup, tortilla soup. My favorite entrees- seitan stew, chickpea dishes (they have several that are very good), stuffed peppers, penne with roasted tomatoes. Another pro tip- you can make yourself a quesadilla* if you take a tortilla from the sandwich station, fold it and add cheese, and then put it in the panini press! Then you can add salsa or guac from the enchilada bar. \u000aRoMa: Indian food every Saturday dinner* (the paneer is amazing), pierogis, vegetable lo mein, seitan and potato soup, vegetable pot pie, mac and cheese, cheese and potato soup, cheese/roasted veggies/fancy bread bar*, fancy pasta*, fancy grilled cheese with tomato from action station*, spaghetti squash, salads* in those nice new bowls!\u000aWhitman: Jamaican jerk chickpeas, vegetable pot pie, bean dishes, spaghetti squash, salad with egg and apple* (I don\u2019t eat here much at all; sorry)\u000aForbes: Okay, every once in a while, they have a special vegetarian/earth-friendly day, where everything offered is vegetarian! That\u2019s probably my favorite food night ever, as it has so many incredible and locally sourced options, like fried avocado flatbread and butternut squash mac and cheese. Otherwise, they usually have very solid veg entrees, like a lot of seitan and bean dishes. Some favorites- kale ceasar salad*, brunch mac and cheese with egg and avocado*, seitan and cauliflower, vegetable chili, alfredo pasta.\u000aCJL: I\u2019ve only eaten here a few times, but it seems like they have really great options! \u000aHope this helps! :)))

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI personally have never found myself in a position where I needed to stay up later than 2am. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only one feeling overwhelmed like this, though. Are you using your time during the day as efficiently as you could? When you\u2019re studying, are you studying effectively or are you distracted? What classes are you taking? Is it an unusually hard 5-class semester, or is this a norm for you? Just some questions to ask yourself.\u000aPerhaps meet with a learning consultant from McGraw to discuss study strategies and ways to make the workload seem more manageable. \u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aI totally feel you, anon. There are just not enough hours in the day! I\u2019m not sure your current schedule is sustainable because going to sleep that late can be very damaging and I think Nick has some really good tips if you\u2019re talking about academic work. Maybe programs like HUM and ISC require such commitment (lmk), but you definitely want to think about whether you\u2019re using time effectively. For example, if you\u2019re constantly staying up late doing a ton of readings, you may want to look into reading a little differently. You may also want to think about how to better build your academic schedule - this semester I essentially have a four day weekend and it\u2019s lovely.\u000aOn the other hand, if activities/work/non-academic stuff are causing you to work later than usual, I can relate and I can assure you that you\u2019re not alone. One of my friends had rehearsal until 12:30 AM the other day and couldn\u2019t begin working until after. A few of my friends are in Hell Week right now (as performers) and are facing that same struggle. I know some people on the Honor Committee or Committee on Discipline who have huge chunks of their time taken up by hearings. And when clubs plan large-scale events, the logistical tedium can be so time consuming. I think there are definitely a good number of Princeton students that tend to overbook themselves, myself included, and that also translates to staying up later than is optimal.\u000aStill, the above examples are more on the temporary side. If you\u2019re constantly working until 5 AM because non-academic work takes up most of your day, then you may need to ask yourself some questions that I know I consistently ask myself. Are you happy in each of your non-academic activities? Would it be possible to take a step back? Realize that these activities, as fun as they are, do need to come second to your studies. \u000aI\u2019ll finish by adding that the worst part of this whole thing, whether it\u2019s academic work or non-academic work that is taking up your time, is normalizing this kind of behavior. After doing it for a few times, you may feel as though it has to be routine, but it doesn\u2019t! I know now that, when I start feeling tired, I won\u2019t be able to get much out of more work, so I go to bed and try to finish up the next day. Listen to your body - you\u2019ll probably feel a lot better if you do. \u000aAnyways, feel free to give us more info as to what is taking up so much of your time! Sorry for the rambling, but I hope this helps you or someone else who may be feeling the same way!

VResponse from Pichu:\u000almao this is a very good point, thank you for your astute observation. we ought to have a room draw advisor for students or something\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI was typing when this got answered. I have some more in-depth thoughts about this, so I\u2019ll post:\u000aI don\u2019t think so. I think RealTalk is very accessible to students. It\u2019s easier to just submit a question on here than try to find your RCA (or text them). We\u2019ll probably answer faster, first of all. Also, there are like 10 of us that consistently check the inbox, so we have a wide range of experiences (wider than your RCA would have just because we are 10 humans as opposed to 1). Also, the anonymity of this site helps. Freshmen might not feel comfortable with their RCAs or other advisors, and the anonymizing nature of this site lets them comfortably submit questions. \u000aThe RCA system is good (I applied and didn\u2019t get accepted, actually). All of the RCAs that I know well are incredible people that genuinely care about their zees. RCAs aside, I think it can take days to get answers from academic advisors via email. We answer questions in minutes to hours. I think it\u2019s the convenience of this site that makes people submit questions so frequently, not the ineffectiveness of the advising system.

Might feel awkward at first, but after a while you\u2019ll feel more comfortable and natural. Don\u2019t right off the bat think about just like getting with chicks or finding your wife (not sure what you\u2019re looking for, like just a hookup on da street or something serious), just be chill and behave in the moment without thinking how you want your interactions with this girl to end up. If you\u2019ve got female friends who can introduce you girls, that\u2019s great (I love my friends) (sometimes). \u000aThis in no way is supposed to be like a formula on how to help you find a female companion, I\u2019m still searching for that. It\u2019s just kind of what I thought of after reading your question. There\u2019s a law in probability called Murphy\u2019s Law, and applied to this situation, it kinda says that if there is any chance of success, you will eventually succeed!\u000aBut honestly, I understand how you feel lonely, but don\u2019t stress too much over it, you\u2019re still in college and got your whole life ahead of you to find a female companion.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aYeah this has happened before. I would try to move on as much as possible and get the idea out of your head that you will  be with him/her, at least for the time being. Just because the person doesn\u2019t love you doesn\u2019t mean that you guys can\u2019t still be friends and you can still have a great non-romantic relationship.\u000aI also find that keeping the idea in my mind that the crush is just one of several potential people that I could be infatuated with helps. There\u2019s a whole ocean of others out there to be potential soulmates and just be happy that at least the person is your friend. Lastly, if it\u2019s your friend, then I assume that you want him/her to be happy and what\u2019s best for the person. For me, I find that it helps to realize and accept that it may be in both my and the person\u2019s best interest to not get together. The person knows him/herself the best and if they don\u2019t think you\u2019re right for them, then it\u2019s for the best.\u000aBut yeah, it\u2019s never easy and often takes time.

Some professors allow that, especially if you have a valid reason for poor performance on the midterm (eg, test anxiety and blanking).

VResponse from Pichu:\u000aI took this class my freshman fall (2014). I basically didn\u2019t do any readings. The essays were pretty easy to bullshit and I got good grades on those assignments, and my inability to contribute in precept due to not reading did not matter because precept participation didn\u2019t count towards our final grade. However, we had an in-class test at the end of the year (and checking the registrar, it looks like you have a final exam for this class as well). And for that you HAVE to do the readings in their entirety, there\u2019s no way to do well on it otherwise. So that fucked me lol.\u000aI think this class is taught differently year to year (I see there\u2019s problem sets this year, we didn\u2019t have any problem sets), but I would suggest you do the readings at some point, you can skip some if you\u2019re running out of time, but i highly recommend reading most/all of it before the final exam and don\u2019t leave it all for reading period or else you might be reading like a billion pages of the most boring and hard-to-read shit over reading period. Good grades on the essays can be a false indicator of how you will do on the tests if you don\u2019t read, you need to read for the tests

I have a solid group of friends both inside/outside of the club that I\u2019m content with. Don\u2019t worry about being anti-social. The street =/= social life.

I think one of the main things in an LDR is to strike a balance between your relationship and your college life. If it gets too overbearing, it can really detract from your other commitments and relationships. One of my friends ended up breaking up with her boyfriend because of this. They had a very serious relationship, but he just had super high expectations, and wanted to be talking to her all the time. He would text or DM or snapchat her literally all day and respect constant responses, and then would also want to FaceTime with her for several hours at night. At some point, she realized that that was detracting from her social and professional life at school, and once they broke up, she felt relieved of that commitment. But again, the same can be said of the opposite. My other friend literally hardly ever talked to her boyfriend, and at some point, she started to question why they were in a relationship at all! \u000aI think the same thing can be said with the open relationship thing. Situations like that can very easily get messy. You need to really realize how you feel and communicate that to your boyfriend. It\u2019s a really difficult situation if, for example, you say that you\u2019re okay with him hooking up with other girls (or boys!) but then feeling betrayed or angry if he does. Feeling that way is totally understandable, but it\u2019s important to recognize that feeling and decide if the open relationship will actually work. \u000aI will say this- if you really care about each other and are honest and communicate well, then you can make it work. My roommate is in probably the cutest LDR ever, and both of my friends had some great times with their LDR boyfriends. Some things that worked well for my friends- making semi-regular (maybe once or twice per semester and on breaks) to visit each other, being thoughtful and remembering the important things that are going on in their lives (one of my friends had an important final, and her boyfriend sent her flowers for it, but even just talking or calling is really vital), communicating when things aren\u2019t working, sharing your lives with each other, etc. Good luck!!

Right now we live like an hour away, but he's leaving for college in July, and we'll be states away then. Any ideas/advice? Could an open relationship work while we try to be together as much as possible? How do people view open relationships? Thanks haha!

It will obviously depend on the context- for example, walking up to a big group of guys and trying to approach one person might be weird. Maybe try to catch him alone or with only one or two other people instead. Using your mutual friends (or even just outgoing people) can also be a good strategy for this. For example, your friend can introduce the two of you, and the \u201chey, have you met Mia yet?\u201d strategy always works well. \u000aResponse from Lion Rampant:\u000aOfc not!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aSorry to hear that! Check your email, because I\u2019ve seen multiple positions emailed out to listservs every day. Use sources like LinkedIn to search positions and work your connections. Check with old employers and see if any of them would be willing to have you back. Contact professors or professionals and see if any of them would be willing to take you on for research or a job this summer. Look on Student Employment (there\u2019s occasionally internships posted there). Double check and make sure there are no unfilled internships with PEI, PICS, etc. that interest you.  Also, make an appointment with an advisor at Career Services! They can help you with your internship search and can look over your resume and cover letters. They\u2019ll also be able to point you in the direction of opportunities that might be a good fit for you.

I never realized how much so until I went to an older friend\u2019s room at like 10:30 pm on a Saturday, and all you could hear was loud music and people talking. Inside, they also lack a lot of the amenities that some of the res colleges have, like hardwood floors, renovated spaces, private bathrooms, trash chutes, elevators, air conditioning, etc. I will say that I really don\u2019t think they\u2019re AS bad as people make them out to be, and if I had to live there next year, I wouldn\u2019t think it would be the end of the world. They\u2019re just different from how a lot of people in res colleges are used to living!

Main Inn kind of deal! The rooms in Whitman that I would personally avoid are the ones with weird shapes and then ones on the top floor, because some of them have slanted roofs that make the room feel way smaller. Other than that, I\u2019d go for size, and those will probably be the \u201cbest\u201d singles. Oh, and other best singles- those rooms that are four single rooms attached to a common room. Those are awesome, although had to get as an underclassman.

VResponse from Harvey:\u000ai am so emotionally needy that it manifests itself in the form of touchiness - a burden that all my friends have come to bear \u000aResponse from Amygdala:\u000awell that wasn\u2019t particularly helpful so I would just suggest actively trying to spend more time with people you like being around! Honestly having a good set of friendships is in many ways more valuable than having a romantic partner; having a handful of people you can turn to and who understand the different parts of your life is really special. Try to actively appreciate and enjoy the time you spend with your friends and to invite them to events and stuff.\u000aResponse from Anything Clever \u201817:\u000aLoneliness is completely natural, especially in the spring when schedules get packed, people are busier, and tensions are higher. That being said, it sounds like there are two possible issues here: one is that your friends are starting relationships while you are not, and new relationships are a time suck, so you may be seeing them less. If that\u2019s the case, be open with your friends - tell them you miss them, that you\u2019ve been feeling down, ask for a friend night. Quality time with those you care about on this campus might help. On the other hand, the issue may be that you do want a relationship, whether or not you have the time for it. You might want to take the time to think about whether you\u2019re open to meeting someone romantically or not rather than just excluding the possibility due to time. Finally, emotional \u201cweirdness\u201d, as normal as it may be on Princeton\u2019s campus, is still exhausting and difficult to deal with. I always think it\u2019s worth trying to see CPS - worst case it\u2019s unhelpful and you lost one hour trying to improve your well being (which is never a waste of time) and best case they get you on track to understand and address your emotions better. Regardless, try taking quality time with YOURSELF, whether that means watching your favorite tv show/movie, exercising, reading a book - whatever makes you feel good. Spend time on yourself, because sometimes the lack of it manifests as loneliness. Good luck friend, hope you feel better \u2764\ufe0f

VResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816: \u000athis question wasn\u2019t for me, but I do have some tips to share. I like to think of procrastination as something that just naturally happens if you put yourself in the environment where it\u2019s possible. In other words, you have some level of control over it. The most common methods of procrastination, I would say, are sleep (if you work in your room/on your bed, so just don\u2019t do that), long meals, wasting time on the phone or internet, and doing other things to avoid the main project you need to work on. \u000aFirst, something that was revolutionary for me when I was trying to eliminate distractions and enhance focus to decrease procrastination was learning to limit my access to unnecessary online sites and to my phone. To do this, I have started using this app called SelfControl, which lets you put in sites to block and how much time you want to not be able to access them. For me, that list includes netflix and facebook, but also nytimes, allrecipes, reddit - basically any site I find myself perusing randomly. As for my phone, I either leave it on do not disturb, or what\u2019s better, I leave it in another room or in a different part of the room I\u2019m in, so I have to actively go out of my way to access it. This way, I can consciously stop myself or at least feel bad if I use it, which will motivate me to limit that.\u000aAs for long meals, this usually happens when you eat in a big dhall where you know a lot of people. What might help here is working on a different side of campus (in a classroom or in the library - anywhere where you can limit distractions as much as possible, ie not a dhall or public area like Frist) and then going to a dhall that you go to less frequently. You might also find better food there, so you can justify it that way.\u000aWhen it comes to doing other work to avoid the main thing you need to do (eg, checking emails, doing a pset that isnt due til much later, etc), what has worked for me is making ordered lists and then going down the list. Just keep reminding yourself that you WILL have time to do the other work later, and you just need to finish the other stuff first. I\u2019ve also heard that \u201cif you have something to do that takes less than 5 minutes, just do it so that it\u2019s not weighing on you and people aren\u2019t waiting on you.\u201d I use this at times, but not for everything, and I especially try to avoid it (since it\u2019s usually email) when I\u2019m in the zone/have momentum with a project I\u2019m working on.\u000a\u000aHope this helps!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI eventually got into one too! I had to turn it down due for financial reasons unfortunately, but if you can pay for it or got good funding, then go for it! I have a bunch of friends who have been on them in the past, and none of them have anything but good things to say. The professor of the seminar is a really great resource, so ask her or him any questions that you have. Also, if you know anyone who has been on one, you can definitely reach out to them about their experiences. Grading probably depends on the course, so take that this with a grain of salt, but everyone I know who has been on them has gotten an A or an A-. You do have to do work though lol (usually readings and papers).

For example, I know someone who has REALLY severe allergies to a lot of bath products, so she gets special needs housing for a private bathroom so she doesn\u2019t have a reaction using a public one. You can usually pick a friend to live next to or near you, but they won\u2019t make any more than two singles available to your group.

I thought it was nice :)\u000aYou should definitely offer to pay them, though. They may say that it\u2019s not necessary, to which you should counter with an offer to pay for part of the groceries, or to help out with cleaning the house every week, or to do yard work for them, or something like that. They may continue to say no, in which case you\u2019d just act really thankful and bring a thoughtful gift, etc., but it\u2019d be very rude to not offer (and to not persist a few times after they\u2019ve said it\u2019s not necessary).\u000aResponse from Harvey:\u000aI\u2019m actually doing this!

It\u2019s definitely easier to deck out a quad and make it dope than it is a triple.\u000anot sure if you\u2019re a rising junior or current junior, but if you\u2019re a rising junior, maybe wait until most of the seniors r done picking to get a sense of the options of triples vs quads left.

But tbh if you\u2019re not getting a 4 or 5 on the AP exam, your Spanish probably isn\u2019t that great and you will probably test into a pretty low level of Spanish.

VResponse from Harvey:\u000anope! I think Princeton is actually really unique (and generous) in that they give us an incredible amount of time to drop (9 weeks), and if the class is dropped within that time period, it doesn\u2019t show up on your class! PDF period is before the 9 weeks, so you\u2019re good. I don\u2019t think most colleges are that lenient in terms of dropping class that late/transcript

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aI don\u2019t think Brown has ever been considered independent. The co-op and the dorm have no real relationship and you cannot guarantee a Brown room just because you\u2019re in the co-op. However, Brown rooms kind of suck so there\u2019s a really high chance you can get one if you want one. I was in the bottom quarter of junior draw and ended up in Brown.

VResponse from Olivia Pope:\u000aYeah, I went to a couple sessions during the spring of my sophomore year. It was a positive experience for me in that I got to finally sit down with someone and release my feelings without feeling guilty because that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. The one thing is that it can oftentimes take a while to get an initial appointment. However, in my case my situation was urgent and so I scheduled an appointment the day of and got to see someone that day which was really helpful. The trick with mental health counseling is that you need to find someone that you feel comfortable with. The counselor that I saw on my urgent appointment wasn\u2019t my favorite but the subsequent appointments that I had were with a different counselor who I felt a better connection with. \u000aResponse from Ariel:\u000aCPS has been a regular part of my Princeton career. I thought they were super helpful in terms of the college adjustment process, as I had a difficult time assimilating. Even now, after I feel comfortable on campus I still go and just talk about whatever I feel the need to vent about. Like Olivia said, having someone there just to listen to you is extremely cathartic. I highly suggest making an appointment, especially knowing it may take a little bit to get that initial one. However, once you\u2019re in the system it\u2019s easy to just set a recurring appointment so if you can tough it out till your first visit, it gets easier. I can\u2019t say enough good things about my experience, it was one of the best choice I\u2019ve made this year, and I have friends who have had similar experiences.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aHahaha, yeah that\u2019s what I was for my first job! (eventually moved on to other companies) I got paid 12 bucks an hour initially (but I did get a 30% discount on all Abercrombie and Fitch merchandise). To boost our egos we\u2019re suppose to call ourselves  \u2018floor models\u201d or \u201csales models\u201d. But we were basically sales representatives (and sometimes cashiers), showcasing the products and answering questions on clothing for customers. Only at some locations though do floor models actually have to man the cash register, restock the clothes racks, and spray it with overpriced cologne. So I guess depending on your perspective, floor (cashier) models are actually just sales people.\u000aLooking back on it though, it was a terrible experience. Being told to starve and dehydrate yourself, to go to the gym constantly, and never to wear black (as it doesn\u2019t fit in with the merchandise) was horrendous. Everyone was so shallow and I do feel somewhat guilty for standing with a bunch of shirtless guys on Fifth Ave, pressuring young adolescent girls to come and buy something they don\u2019t need and is overpriced.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aI think so. Princeton is a better school. You\u2019re presumably into gov stuff, but tbh the advantages of being in DC are much less pronounced in undergrad than post-grad education imo. Also the Princeton brand works great for that kind of stuff as well (for example, I know many sophomores with state department internships this summer), so don\u2019t choose georgetown because of some chimeric idea of networking. You can network WAY hard here\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI don\u2019t know if I completely agree with that. It depends on why you are into Georgetown. It is a Jesuit school and that obviously brings a much different feel and environment that some people prefer. It\u2019s just a very different culture with a larger student body, urban environment, and more serious sports fan base.\u000aThat being said, I do agree with Winnie that Princeton is objectively speaking a better school and it is very easier to network so that the advantage of being in DC for government work is not really significant. But Princeton is also harder to do well in than Georgetown. At the end of the day, I don\u2019t think that you can go wrong with either, so you should choose the place where you envision yourself the happiest and can best achieve your goals. Don\u2019t choose based on name or reputation.\u000aresponse: but name/reputation is definitely something to consider, depending on your career goals!

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aIt can really go both ways. If you want to keep it totally casual, you should (a) know and be okay with the fact that there\u2019s no such thing as truly \u201cno strings attached,\u201d especially when you\u2019re friends, and (b) be prepared for the high chance that at least something will change in your dynamic. With respect to (a), I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a bad thing, but don\u2019t be surprised if your feelings are confusing, if there\u2019s an emotional aspect since you\u2019re already friends, etc. With respect to (b), you just have to both be really in-tune with yourselves and how you approach sex, and you have to be prepared for any consequences that do occur. \u000aSo\u2026 I think it\u2019s less black-and-white than a \u201cbad or good idea.\u201d \u000aEDIT: and with respect to the small community thing, it was just something I mentioned yesterday because the Princeton rumor mill is vicious and people are petty and immature af here. If you run into an ex-hookup, sure it can be a lil awkward, but as long as you\u2019re both acting like adults it won\u2019t be a big deal at all.\u000aResponse from Anything Clever \u201817:\u000aI think the most important advice I could give you here is to talk frankly with this person. Having the \u2018casual\u2019/expectations talk isn\u2019t super sexy or spontaneous, I know, but chances are if you\u2019re not comfortable having that conversation with this person, things WILL eventually get awkward and uncomfortable because you guys aren\u2019t open enough with each other to communicate honestly. Also, having that discussion is likely to head off much worse conversations later on. Now, assuming you\u2019ve had that conversation and everyone is on the same page, it\u2019s really up to you. Do you think this is someone that you could still be chill with after having casual sex for a while? If not, is the friendship low-stakes enough that it would be worth the potential awkwardness later? Just clarify those things for yourself first, and then clarify with her: is she interested? Is she cool with it just being casual? And make sure you discuss other sexual partners because STDs are real, especially on college campuses.\u000aResponse from Sigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000aI\u2019d also add that you should consider mutual friends and how they might feel about this, especially if it were to make it awkward for you two down the line. You might make it harder to interact with those mutual friends when both of you are present. I second the idea that you should have the conversation earlier rather than later, because things would just get increasingly more complicated and difficult to discuss later. It\u2019s also important to think about whether moving in this direction might make either of you start considering something more serious in the future, and whether or not you would want that. It\u2019s easy to just say it\u2019s casual, but it often becomes more than that and can make for unbalanced expectations and desires, which would really sour the entire \u201ccasual hookup\u201d dynamic. Good luck with the conversation!\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aHmmm I agree that mutual friends are a factor to consider, but only up to a point. You\u2019re two consenting adults thinking about having sex for yourselves. How your friends feel about it is totally secondary. It would be completely immature and objectively strange of them to suddenly have a problem hanging out with both of you at the same time just because you\u2019ve had sex.\u000aRe-response from Sigmund Floyd:\u000aSorry for the confusion; my point was more about the potential fallout than during the hookup-phase. I speak from experience when I say that people can \u201cpick sides\u201d if things get awkward between two members of a friend group, and it can really strain the whole dynamic. I agree that when starting out, it should be a secondary concern, but I maintain that that does not mean that it is irrelevant. Also, it would not necessarily be strange for someone to feel uncomfortable if two of his/her friends start to become involved, especially if it\u2019s a small group. Like, if three people are friends and two of them start a physical relationship, the third can start to feel like a third wheel. At this point, if the person making the decision about bringing up the topic is already trying to consider how it might affect his/her relationship with the other person, they would probably want to consider how it might hurt their other friendships. Sorry to complicate things, but I think it\u2019s worth mentioning and considering.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aNo, not really. I think not that many people do internships or research, since not even our winter break is that long, but most people that do those do it over winter break and prob not other breaks. \u000aI really like to travel every intersession, cuz there\u2019s nothing that I might need to do school-wise (so last year I went to Italy, this year Russia). Over normal breaks I go home, so I can get some work done and see my family. Over winter break I either stay at home the whole time or maybe go visit some family in NY for part of it. I don\u2019t really think you need to worry about forcing yourself to do things during break; just do whatever seems most fun. I would definitely recommend travel if you can! Especially intersession is most convenient for it.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aHi welcome! :) Personally, I would recommend it! I was a little nervous about quads and stuff coming into Princeton, because the quads and triples that I had seen before coming here were basically three our four sets of furniture jammed in one room. However, here I think the living situations are designed very nicely to allow for some separation. Most quads are made up of a common room and at least two bedrooms, and possibly a bathroom depending on your res college. Triples are typically at least two or three rooms, and doubles can be one or two rooms. \u000aI think the quad situation is nice because it gives you a set of people to hang out with right out of the gate, and the common room is really nice for inviting people over and just hanging out. Roommates can also be a nice support system if you\u2019re away from home for the first time. I find it great to have people around to zip up my dress or rant to about my stupid life problems. However, if you know you are someone who has trouble getting along with people for extended periods of time, I would probably caution against it, because it can lead to more trouble than it\u2019s worth. I guess the other negative simply comes with living people- you\u2019ll have to accommodate other people\u2019s schedules and needs. I think setting up a clear roommate contract at the beginning of the year is and sticking to it is a good way to mitigate conflict. Lmk if that doesn\u2019t make sense haha, sorry that was a lot.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI don\u2019t think you should worry about your looks too much. I think a great deal of people at Princeton are not that shallow in that they would judge your value as a lover based primarily based on appearance. Personality, character, and interests are far more important (at least for me).\u000aThat being said, the problem won\u2019t be looks, but rather that college is mainly dominated by hookup culture. Most people don\u2019t really have the time or want the commitment of a real relationship. They\u2019re too busy focused on academics or they\u2019re too pre-professional. \u000aTbh, that\u2019s the thing I miss the most about HS. I thought life would be great being single and free, which it still is. But, at the same time, I realized that after almost two years I deeply long for a meaningful relationship and miss being able to translate my affection to someone who desires me and  have personal discussions again. But on the bright side, I also happen to know a significant number of couples and I think there is still hope for you here and you can\u2019t ever know what could have happened unless you put yourself out there. I haven\u2019t given up hope (yet).

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aLast year I studied abroad in Portugal at a non-Princeton Program and was awarded a $1000 scholarship by the Spanish and Portuguese Program. You can can funding through SAFE, but generally only for institutions that are non-American.\u000aI also took a Linear Algebra Course at NYU prior to leaving for Portugal and in this case I had to pay for all of it. However, I got a huge discount due to a family connection.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI was wondering about that all of Freshman year and actually asked for my application file before it was deleted.\u000aThey overlooked my lower GPA and test scores as small hiccups. Apparently they thought I would contribute to the diversity of campus as I lived abroad for many years of my young life and I\u2019m racially mixed. I also originally thought I was going to be Woody Woo and they liked how I spoke four languages, spent time volunteering in impact groups in Latin America and Africa, and had strong ambition and drive to pursue areas outside of my comfort zone.\u000aI think they also liked my essay, which turned one of my passions (music) into \u201cPrinceton in the Nation\u2019s Service.\u201d Long story short, it was about how I was volunteering at a psychiatric center for individuals with severe mental illnesses and I was teaching people how to better cope through music. After a few sessions, I was helping this one woman write a song called the \u201cJudge\u201d, and the psychiatrists and I realized that the person described in the song was actually her father who was sexually abusing her.\u000aLastly, although I didn\u2019t do great in HS by Princeton standards, I still had high enough grades and test scores to demonstrate I could handle the workload.

VSigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000a\u000aI tried a couple of different things during my time.\u000a1) stored with a family member in the area (more for clothes and small items rather than furniture)\u000a2) sold it on tigertrade or buy/sell facebook page, then bought new stuff with roommates the following year (if I needed to)\u000a3) let someone who\u2019s staying over the summer use it and then take it back at the end of the summer (hard to coordinate, especially with the few weeks where no one\u2019s on campus, but it\u2019s a win-win if you can get it to work out).\u000a4) the student agency is also good for stuff like boxes of clothes, not too sure how good it is for like furniture and appliances. I think tigertrade might be a better options for those large things.

There aren\u2019t too many that are social but it\u2019s worth trying them. What about classes..pset or study groups are another idea. In general look for things that happen often, because a service group that meets once a week isn\u2019t the best way to meet new people compared to an a cappella or dance group for example

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aMy personal philosophy on college sex is to do whatever you feel comfortable with. I know it sounds cliche, but it\u2019s honestly true. I have friends who have slept with 20+ people and friends who haven\u2019t slept with anyone, and I don\u2019t have any right to judge either one. Your sex life is a personal decision, and you reserve the right to say yes or no whenever you damn well please. \u000aFor me personally (maybe not you or everyone reading this blog), I think I generally try to be careful about doing things when either I or the other person is too drunk. I\u2019ve had some really sloppy drunk DFMOs which is whatever, but I would not say it\u2019s the most recommendable way to hook up with someone. There\u2019s also an important consent issue with alcohol, so just be careful. I also personally would not sleep with somebody random or somebody that I brought home from the Street (again, if that\u2019s your thing, you do you), and have a few friends who have gotten in sticky situations or regretted doing that. In terms of a good time to start (lol love the way that\u2019s phrased), again that should be whatever you feel comfortable with!\u000aAnyways; TLDR- you do you, be safe and have fun! Bateman also says that this is \u201cclassic mia tmi\u201d but whatever hope this helps!  \u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI agree with everything Mia said and want to add that when you come to college, you tend to vastly overestimate how big this community is. If you do decide to play the field, more power to you, have fun, be safe, etc. etc. Just make sure you\u2019re comfortable running into past hookups all the time.\u000aAlso, make a McCosh appointment after every new partner. It\u2019s only, like, $14 for a full screening. Small price to pay for the potential benefits, IMO. Sex can have fuckin serious consequences, and you shouldn\u2019t leave your health up to the honesty and health of someone else.\u000aAnd for god\u2019s sake pls always use protection if it\u2019s not monogamous. Sexual liberation doesn\u2019t have to mean carelessness. If anyone has a problem with you requiring protection, they\u2019re a loser who doesn\u2019t deserve to have sex w/ you, and you can relish rejecting them knowing you dodged a bullet.

VResponse from Exupery: \u000aLol so many probing questions. I think for a long time, especially in middle school and high school, my answer would have been intelligence just because of insecurity about my appearance. At this point in my life I am happy with both parts of myself, and I guess what I really value most in myself/am most proud of is my work ethic.\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aBelieve it or not, I actually modeled for Abercrombie and Fitch and American Eagle in HS to make extra cash and had an inflated ego. Hung out in NYC with slim, 5\u203210, trophy girls who were as artificial as it gets. So back then I would for sure say that I had more confidence in my appearance. I was also not the most studious person and frequently skipped class, got a 25% on a Calc test and a 3 on my AP Chem Exam. One of my teachers actually told me I was a \u201cloose cannon\u201d, incapable of grasping complicated concepts, and that I should act more like my peers.\u000aBut then college came by and the opposite happened! I can\u2019t catch a cold now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been approached by a sober girl in months! All the modeling agencies broke their contracts with me as well (starting to think I was average looking enough that shy guys could imagine themselves as me). It\u2019s all good though, I needed to be taken down a notch. Funny thing too, is that now professors actually believe in me, I\u2019m a tutor for McGraw and languages, and other students think I can actually help them with learning. So I guess the tables have turned and now I would say confidence in intelligence is higher. But keep the probing questions coming, I\u2019m an open book (at least online).\u000a\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000a\u000aDefinitely intelligence. I think I\u2019m a relatively good looking guy and work hard to maintain my body, but I just know my intelligence is what\u2019s going to get me places.\u000aResponse from John Shade:  if we\u2019re going on what\u2019s going to get me places then I suppose I\u2019m most confident in my feet.\u000atru cuz feet take you places

VResponse from Pablo:\u000aSo, I didn\u2019t think there was too much prep needed. Just pay close attention to take ECO 100 and you should really be fine. And make sure you master the math concepts when they come out. These are excellent moments to go to office hours because lectures don\u2019t spend much time on them and they\u2019re more or less just learn-on-your-own type things.\u000aOh! And I think you need MAT 175, so that might be helpful. Good luck!\u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI second what Pablo said! Skipping w AP Credit is totally okay too. You don\u2019t need math for every upper-level option- one requires no math, one requires MAT 103, and one requires MAT 175 I believe (double check that lol). One thing I would really recommend is to fine a solid study group to do psets or prepare for exams with. A lot of times a concept will make a lot more sense if a friend is explaining it to you!

VSigmund Floyd \u201816:\u000a\u000aalum here who\u2019s just finishing up the med school application/interview process. I would say that coming from pton, the rigor of your courses won\u2019t be doubted, but you still need to fulfill the pre-med requirements and take the MCAT. Your grades and numbers there, as well as your rec letters and how substantial your thesis is, are indicators of your course rigor and academic competence. \u000aHPA has a very interesting document that lists where people in each of the most common pre-med majors/divisions were accepted, and you can see from that that a typically pre-med major like MOL isn\u2019t required or even guaranteed to get you anything. Personally, I think it\u2019s MUCH more important to pursue what you are interested in, not only because you\u2019d be more motivated to do the related work and excel in it, but because it makes you unique and in this case, would also allow you to pursue two other programs that could provide you with additional sets of knowledge and skills that you can use in your future career. \u000aThis goes for your activities outside of your academics as well, and it is especially important when it comes to interviews, when you\u2019ll be asked about your activities and motivations, and I would say that it\u2019s really obvious when you\u2019ve done something to check a box rather than because you were personally interested in it. People are also more interested in hearing about the less traditional aspects of your path than what everyone else has done, especially if you can tie it back to medicine in some way. You\u2019d be surprised how your extracurricular interests can translate into parts of your medical career if you keep an eye out, and now may be the best time for you to figure out what drives you and what you\u2019d like to integrate into your future career.

I wanted to be EEB, because I think the material is interesting, but as a pre-med I'm nervous that my coursework (though upper-level biology) won't be considered as 'rigorous' as MOL courses would be. I know course rigor does matter to med schools and, especially bc I have had non-rigorous course loads in the past, I don't know what to do. Being MOL would also mean sacrificing 2 certificates, so any thoughts or advice?

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aDo you mean professors for actual music courses? Or do you mean teachers for lessons on how to sing or play an instrument?\u000aResponse from Princess Mia: \u000aIf you mean private teachers, here is a list of faculty. You can also find their names/emails on princeton.edu/music. If you want to get in touch with them to talk about lessons or the music program before coming to campus, that would be the way. If you actually are interested in taking lessons, then you actually sign up or audition at the beginning of the school year, so no need to worry now. For many of the instruments/voice parts, the school only has one teacher on the faculty, so it won\u2019t be too much of a choice. For those with more of a choice, you can talk to any older students in the studio, talk to the teacher, take a trial lesson, or look up their credentials online.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aMy experience with ECO has been great so far.  It\u2019s really quite a flexible major with only 5 departmentals in addition to the three core classes. Especially if you have A.P. credit, it means that students can really pursue a lot of other intellectual interests. I really enjoy most of my courses and one of the best aspects of the classwork is that it forces you to really problem solve and consider everything you\u2019ve ever learned in the subject material. We\u2019re always building upon previous work and examining relationships between everything in order to deepen our understanding. Another thing which is special, is our faculty. Forget all the Nobel Prize BS for a moment Our lecturers and professors really want to be here and love teaching undergraduates. They are extremely knowledgeable and more importantly they know how to explain in-depth and complicated theories to students (mostly). They could easily be working in government or the private sector, but they chose us instead. More importantly, I think ECO is the most politically and intellectually diverse department on campus. We have professors from all political viewpoints and it\u2019s very refreshing compared to other classes. We get to hear arguments from both sides and in the end we make up our minds. This is why we have both socialist and libertarian students in this department! \u000aThat being said, I do think some stuff is annoying such as the senior comprehensive exam and a lot of the lower level classes are filled with too many students. Also, the core classes can be aggravating l like 310 or Econometrics, which are often poorly taught, boring, and worst of all, unhelpful.\u000aMy advice to a prospective major is to choose ECO because you are intrigued by its methodology and way of thinking. You enjoy theory and are also very comfortable in math (at Princeton we only have two choices: math or slightly less math compared to other places where Multi isn\u2019t even required). DO NOT choose ECO because it\u2019s the most popular major and you want to land a Wall Street job. \u000aOnce you\u2019ve settled on ECO, I would recommend using AP credit if you feel that you have a very good grasp on the content. For sure, use AP Stats and Calc if you have it. Don\u2019t let intro and core classes be the example of the major. Make sure you put yourself out there and don\u2019t be afraid to approach professors and talk to them. Also ask for help when you need it. This is a big department and it can be easy to get lost and get anxious because nobody is going to be checking up on you all the time compared to\u2026 a language course or something like that.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI\u2019ve cooked for myself the last two summers (on campus and at the children\u2019s hospital of philly this past summer), and I don\u2019t think it was too time consuming or a hassle. Maybe took me 7 minutes to pack my lunch and max of 20 to make dinner? I also eat very simply over the summer, though. For lunches I packed a ham sandwich, an apple, and a bag of pretzels or chips of some kind every day. For dinners, I alternated between scrambled eggs, pizza bagels, ham sandwiches, simple pasta with marinara sauce, grilled cheese, and eating out. Literally this is all I cooked. I also had bagels and cream cheese and cereal which I sometimes ate if I didn\u2019t feel like walking to the kitchen to make something. So my eating over the summer may not be representative if you\u2019re tryna cook some more fancy meals ? \u000aEven if you really cook, though, what else are you gonna do this summer? Haha after you get home from lab you have all night to yourself! Not like you have psets or extracurriculars! A lot of people like to cook with friends which can be fun too! I think cooking is a much better option than the meal plan (and you save tons of money)! Sorry my cooking probably isn\u2019t what most humans would eat for a summer lol.\u000aResponse from Exupery:\u000aOmg 20 minutes?? I also lived on campus last summer and cooking from start to finish (including cleaning up) was easily 1 - 1.5 hour. Granted, a lot of that time was spent waiting for burners to free up since I often started cooking at high-traffic hours (between 6:30 and 7:30pm, generally). I mostly made dishes like stir fry, fried rice, \u201cfancy\u201d ramen, and curry. My culinary innovation this summer was realizing that rice + vegetable + tofu/egg drizzled in soy sauce and sesame oil is super tasty, fast, and cheap, and also hits the major food groups. I cooked with my boyfriend and we made 4 meals every dinner (one dinner and one lunch for each of us). \u000aOverall it was pretty enjoyable. If the kitchen wasn\u2019t too crowded, we would play music or stream a TV show while cooking. We also often cooked in a larger group with a few other friends, which was fun. It probably would have been a little more tiresome on my own, but I only spent $40/week on food so the savings were really large!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aHm, I\u2019d say anything ~300 square feet or bigger. You\u2019ll probably be able to notice a difference; 40 sq feet is about the size of a small shed. One room is 140 sq feet per person, and the other is 160 sq feet per person, so I guess there\u2019s a tangible change there. However, in my opinion, that\u2019s not enough to justify certain other factors. For example, I\u2019d take the smaller of the two if it were in a hallway with my friends, or if the 320 sq ft room was on the 4th floor with no elevator. Just weigh the pros and cons of each!

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aHey! Sorry, I haven\u2019t been checking the site as much as I do at school. So I was on campus the summer after my freshman year, and I\u2019m going to be on campus again this summer for my thesis research! Princeton offers on-campus housing for students for about $200/week (it\u2019s actually like $190 if I remember correctly, it worked out to about 1900 for my 10 week program freshman summer). They usually have 3 buildings open for students to live in (Pyne, either Bloomberg or Scully, and I think 1903 were the 3 open my freshman year). There\u2019s a separate room draw for this that starts around April 1st. You\u2019ll probably get an email about it. There are kitchens in all of the buildings that students live in over the summer, so I\u2019m planning to cook for myself. The meal plan on campus is hella expensive and not worth it in my opinion. If you\u2019re doing research for a prof, you should ask if they have any extra funds or grant money floating around that you might be able to use to cover the cost of housing. I ended up getting a $4000 stipend through the neuroscience department my freshman summer, then on top of that I got $2000 from the NSF through my prof directly to cover housing. This way you can actually pocket your full stipend if it works out like it did for me! So that\u2019s the housing/food situation. I\u2019d say the majority of students cook for themselves. It gets super busy in the kitchens around dinner time every night. I usually went to the gym from like 5-8 so that I wouldn\u2019t need to cook until 9 (then the kitchen was quieter). ALSO it gets fucking hot in Pyne over the summer (no AC kill me). Especially if you ever sleep with anyone\u2026 I had 2 heavy duty fans in my room that I pointed directly at me while I was sleeping. This made it bearable. Also try to get into Scully/Bloomberg (AC in there).\u000aIt is very peaceful on campus. I literally loved my summer freshman year. There\u2019s only a few hundred kids on campus, everything\u2019s quiet, the gym isn\u2019t crowded, everything is perfect honestly. The Tow Path is beautiful in the summer (would recommend 10/10 if you enjoy running). Being on campus for the summer gives you a chance to actually enjoy your time at Princeton without any stress!!\u000aAs far as students hanging out\u2026 If you have friends that are also on campus, then absolutely. I have a bunch of MOL friends that will be on campus this summer, so I\u2019m looking forward to endless wine nights and trips to the city and stuff (I never go to the city during the year). But my freshman summer I didn\u2019t really know anyone on campus, so I didn\u2019t really hang out with people too much except like in lab. I was hooking up with someone all summer so he came over a lot lol. I\u2019d say that not many people just spontaneously hang out. I was training for a half ironman triathlon so I ended up spending almost all of my free evening time at the gym. I was in lab like 9am-at least 5pm every night so that kept me busy. I also worked in a library over the weekend to make some extra money (would recommend this as well). Let me know if you have any other questions! It\u2019s quiet here over the summer but enjoyable in my opinion! I\u2019m super excited for another summer on campus!\u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000a@ Nick I think I might be on campus over the summer!

VResponse from Pablo:\u000aI\u2019m so sorry to hear that. These things unfortunately (and frustratingly) happen from time to time. I had a friend get offered an IIP and then be told that they were on the waitlist. I think I would actually raise my concern to the director and ask if there was any way they could help find something or knew of something going on. I know IIP will help fund some programs if you can make contact with an organization of some kind, but that can be kind of difficult. \u000aSome programs (PICS, Grand Health Challenge) may still be taking interns for certain programs. There\u2019s also Handshake and you can also meet with Career Services to find something. There are some internship programs that run on Princeton\u2019s campus with Admissions/Office of the Provost (see Student Employment). I think Camp Kesem and other summer camps around Princeton are also still looking for people, although I\u2019m not really sure. It may also not be too late to join a lab (?). Middlebury Language Programs are also still accepting applications. I also think there is great value in working with local organizations near home, so be sure to reach out (this may just involve more planning on your end). At one point, I was thinking about reaching out to my interviewer because he\u2019s a really cool dude. Again, I\u2019m sorry anon - applications really suck. \u000aIf you want to give us an idea of what you\u2019re looking for, maybe one of us could be of more help. Ultimately, there are options, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something great - hang in there!

VResponse from Princess Mia: \u000aIt\u2019s pretty likely, but not absolutely guaranteed. You can look and see what the quota for your res college is, then how many people are before you in the respective draw, and make your guesses based on that. From looking at how rooms drew last year, my certain guess is that these are the last drawn rooms for upperclassmen in each res college. You\u2019ll notice that a series of rooms were drawn after Spelman and independent housing, but before Forbes/Wilson/Rocky and the rest of Butler/Mathey/Whitman, which leads me to believe that they were upperclassmen drawing into the res colleges. \u000aBAKER S102 Apr 11, 2016 3:50:43 PM (Whitman)\u000aJOLINE 331 Apr 11, 2016 1:17:49 PM (Mathey)\u000aBLOOMBERG 193 Apr 11, 2016 12:47:10 PM (Butler)

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aPersonally, I would choose the small single in Dod. All but a few of the doubles in Scully are around 280 square feet or smaller (so 140 sq feet / person), whereas even the smallest singles in Dod are 120 square feet. In my opinion, 20 extra square feet isn\u2019t enough of a difference to choose a double over a single. Plus, Dod is wayyyyyy more centrally located. That\u2019s just what I would choose though; you do you!  \u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000aI can basically choose any room I want for next year and I think I\u2019m gonna choose a single in Dod over anywhere else (that is, if I don\u2019t get a suite with the others in my draw group, we gotta meet up after break to decide who\u2019s rooming together). Dod and scully basically have the same amenities (except scully has AC and Dod doesn\u2019t), just the location for Dod is way betta. If you care a lot about size then i don\u2019t think like ~20 square feet is worth it, places like patton and 1903 have huge singles like above 200 square feet (i could probably pick one of those singles also, my draw time is just so good hehe, but i think i\u2019d do Dod over them because of the amenities).

As far as roommates go, either talk to people you know are staying, send res college emails, or post in the Facebook group. There will also probably be a Facebook group called something along the lines of \u201cPrinceton in Princeton Summer 2017\u2033 at some point, so you could try posting in there.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aFor me, it means using the very limited resource of time as efficiently as possible. I usually say this is very important because it\u2019s something that made my freshman year very manageable. \u000aAs for specifics, it meant doing things like starting an ECO pset the same day it was assigned. I would try to finish it as if it were due the next day. If there was something I couldn\u2019t do or needed to check, I would go over it with an upperclassmen or TA. I know for a fact people don\u2019t do this because McGraw study halls are empty until the day before a pset is due. Another example is my language class. Instead of watching youtube videos at night or netflix, I would go over conjugations, patterns, etc. Then when I couldn\u2019t go on and needed a break I would finally listen to music or watch youtube\u2026 except I would do it in the language I\u2019m trying to learn. When I went to bed (another good trick if you\u2019re having insomnia) I would think about vocabulary or other school related things and it would knock me right out. E.j. repeating formulas continuously in my head.\u000aFor papers, I set goals and always accomplished them like a number of pages I wanted to write or research that needed to get done. For writing seminar, I put a huge amount of effort into drafts, which made revisions a lot easier. It meant doing things like leaving dinner early or not studying with your friends for a night in order to stay focused. Whenever I couldn\u2019t focus, I would work out, which usually helped me get back on track.\u000aI hope some of these examples help to illustrate and if you need more I would be happy to list more. But in summary, time is a valuable resource and whenever I\u2019m not doing something for leisure, it has to be productive. I always look for more ways to use time better. For example, in the middle of last year, I reviewed material for math and econ weeks before midterms on train rides into NYC instead of staring out the window while listening to music. But sometimes, no matter what you do, you can\u2019t  have everything perfectly under control without compromising more important aspects of life. When I took 5 classes, sometimes it meant staying up until 3am in order to finish 3 ten page papers. But basic principles help to make the journey easier.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aYou mean GPA cutoffs right? Well Princeton is different from a lot of other universities in that GPA is only one of the factors that determine honors. Professors in the department will evaluate you on several other factors as well such as courseload difficulty.\u000aBut if I had to make a rough estimate, I would say cum laude (3.5-3.7), magna cum laude (3.7-3.8), summa cum laud (3.8-4.0). Keep in mind that almost half of all students graduate with some form of honors.

By other camp job, i meant you can def get camp jobs at different camps worst case.\u000aIt\u2019s pretty scummy to accept and then flip the tables on him with no warning. But if you are never planning to do it again in the future, there\u2019s really no downside besides screwing him a little. I guess in this scenario I would probably just accept it. It sounds like you care about the program. If you get an internship later, you should think carefully about which is more important to you, and maybe you\u2019ll decide not to take it in the end. It sounds kind of like you\u2019re a freshman, so just remember that it is not going to screw your career or something either way. But if you feel you need to cancel on him later, you always have an out, and you\u2019re totally capable of cancelling.

VResponse from Winnie P:\u000aThis really depends on a few things, including what you think your chances of your other internships are, and how important this specific camp counseling job is to you. I think that if you were to turn down your camp counseling job, and wait (as long as not an unreasonable amount of time) to find out about other internships, you should still be able to get a job as a camp counselor of some kind if everything fell through, though it might not be head counselor and it might not be that specific type of camp or whatever. \u000aIf you honestly think that you have a good chance (where this means it is a legitimate possibility it could happen, you wouldn\u2019t have to get struck by lightning or anything, like imo I\u2019d say anything where I could see myself getting it at least 1 in 3 times) of getting one of the internships you applied to, and they are all more attractive to you than the camp job, I would turn down the camp counselor job. This is unless the camp counselor job is in a very specific area or camp that is important to you, and you wouldn\u2019t be okay with settling for a different type of counselor job. For the record, though, the summer camp I used to go to in high school definitely accepts people through early May as counselors, so there will definitely still be camp counselor jobs out there, you\u2019re not screwing yourself if everything falls through. \u000aI hope this helps! I recommend taking the leap and hoping! Always better to have faith in yourself and maybe be disappointed than spend the rest of your time wondering what if.

But the director says, he needs to know now whether I'm coming or not and if not, he will need to find someone else to fill my spot. Should I accept the position (even though its head counselor) and wait for internship response if any?

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aDon\u2019t know about most meaningful, but I\u2019d say the best jobs are hands down those where you work in a quiet library on campus and get paid $11.50 an hour to do your homework (I do this and it\u2019s incredible). I also am a paid note taker for the office of disability services. Basically, I go to class and get paid to take notes and send them to a student with a disability who needs notes. It\u2019s actually more than incredible because I get $11 per class to go to physics (which I would be doing even if I wasn\u2019t getting paid\u2026.). 10/10 would recommend both of these jobs, but the note taker thing is kinda luck based on if your classes line up with classes where a notetaker is needed (and if you reply to the email asking for a notetaker fast enough). \u000aI also just got hired as a McGraw Learning Consultant, so I\u2019ll get to start meeting with students in individual consultations to help them study more effectively. I think any sort of tutoring like this would be more meaningful than something like a library job.\u000aResponse from Exupery:\u000aI work in the Writing Center and I love it! It pays $14.80/hour, which is awesome, and the work is super fun and enjoyable. You basically get to learn about tons of different subjects and fields through students\u2019 essays, and it\u2019s definitely meaningful in the sense that you get to help people for free (since students don\u2019t have to individually pay anything.) Last summer I also worked a little bit in the Writing Center for FSI students in particular, and I especially enjoyed that. \u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aI agree with the whole \u201cdo-nothing-while-you-work\u201d jobs! One of my jobs pays nicely and I just have to chill at the work building for a couple hours a week! You could try working at PSAFE which I\u2019ve done for the past two years and, again, you just kind of chill there unless someone needs something - you might need to get van-certified though. And one of my close friends just got hired at Frist and she loves the people there! There are a lot of great jobs around, haha.\u000aAs for meaningful, I 1000% think the best job on campus is being a tour guide. You can always pick up shifts and stuff and actually giving a tour is an absolute blast. You give your \u201cWhy Princeton\u201d at the end of each tour and it just reminds you how much you love this place. Plus, on breaks, you get paid double which is just rad. There\u2019s also the Baby Lab - one of my close friends works there and she enjoys it!

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aIf you can\u2019t meet the recruiter in person, I think the most effective way to get on their radar is to guess their email address and send a really, really good message. (Recruiters also check InMail on LinkedIn; you can use that too.) It should be short (assume that they\u2019ll decide whether they\u2019re interested 3 secs into reading it), compelling, very simply written, and very targeted: who are you, and why are you a fit for the specific role you\u2019re emailing about. (Be friendly and professional, but leave out the silly fluff like \u201cI hope this message finds you well!\u201d etc\u2026) Include your resume and hope for the best as you continue to blast emails out. When you\u2019re looking for your first internship, it\u2019s all about persistence.\u000aAlso: feel free to email about any of the jobs you\u2019ve already applied for. Just because you haven\u2019t heard back doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve been rejected \u2013 or even that your application was reviewed. You should reference the application in the email and just talk about how you wanted to reach out personally to stress interest because XYZ compelling reason, etc.

You get randomly sorted into one of the six, fill out the form without knowing what college you\u2019re in, and then find out both your college assignment and your room assignment together. All six res colleges have singles, but Butler and Whitman have a ton more (rumor has it Meg Whitman hated her freshman year roommate so Whitman was built with a ton of singles lol). If you\u2019re placed into one of those, you\u2019ll have a better chance! The DSLs do freshman placements though, so if you really want a single, you can definitely indicate that on the form, and hopefully they\u2019ll take it into account when putting students into rooms!

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI think Princeton does a great job setting you up to make friends during orientation. Your OA or CA group will be an awesome opportunity to make friends. Even if you don\u2019t become bffs, you\u2019ll at least probably click with a few people on your trip enough to eat meals with them when you first come to campus. The zee group is also a really nice way to have people to talk to when you first arrive. During frosh week, you\u2019ll really have a ton of time to get to know people, and it becomes very easy to meet a ton of frosh. Like maybe you hang out with your roommate and meet their friend from CA, or you hang out with someone from OA and meet their zee group. From that point on, it\u2019s also easy to meet friends in classes or extracurriculars! There\u2019s a very nice vibe at the beginning of freshman year where people are trying to meet each other. I\u2019d say it took me about a month before really settling in, but orientation and older students like your RCA and OA/CA leaders really help to ease that process.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aBefore you come to campus, you\u2019ll be asked to fill out a survey with your rooming preferences. It asks everything from how clean you are, to when you go to bed, to what temperature you like the room to be. It will also ask you how many roommates you would like, at which point you can select \u201cnone\u201d, therefore indicating that you want a single. There\u2019s also a box for additional comments where you can reiterate that you want a single. It\u2019s very possible to get a single as a freshman, especially if you end up being put in Butler or Whitman, because they have a ton of singles. Your odds will overall depend on your res college, just because some have way more than others.

Haven\u2019t heard anyone talk about how good an ECO course was, only how bad the course / the professors were, and how bad the department is.  The only exception is like occasionally ECO 100/101 with Bogan or Harvey Rosen.  I\u2019ve only heard (in some cases, extremely) negative reviews from the typical ECO courses like 310, 301/311, 302/312, 362, and 363 (especially 310). There may be some well-taught 300 or 400-level classes, but I feel like they\u2019d be in more specific fields and you\u2019d have to see if you\u2019re interested in those areas before taking the course.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aSee here for enrollment numbers. (The only lower-level COS classes are 126, 226, and 217.) Click on a class to view the size of each precept. Precept sizes probably range from 5 to 20. COS precepts vary a lot, but they\u2019re often the practical counterpart to lecture, which is typically (though certainly not always) more theoretical. You might run through exercises, discuss the homework, practice particular programming skills, or talk about points of confusion from lecture. Precepts are often (but again not always) participatory, whether that means the preceptor wants students to guide the topics of discussion or just asks people questions throughout the lesson. Preceptors are particularly important for 126, 226, and 217 because they\u2019re typically your point of contact for assignment help (in addition to the lab TAs).

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000a\u000a\u000aTbh, this is exactly why I can never in good faith recommend Princeton to prospective pre-meds without very careful consideration and analysis.\u000aThat being said, \u201cjust scraping by\u201d with an A- is nothing to be ashamed of. If anything, that is impressive. Even a B+ is very good by Princeton standards and this is stated on official transcripts.\u000aI think if you are exhausting evey resource possible, keep trying to squeeze out that A-. I think that every student has his/her limits and cutoffs for returns that they can get from additional effort and studying. A\u2019s are really really tough to get here and try not to feel bad when you put you put a lot of effort and don\u2019t get it. I think you have to recognize that at a certain point, it doesn\u2019t matter what else you do, it won\u2019t get you an A.\u000aAs for med school, you might not be able to get into Harvard medical school with a lower GPA, but with a good MCAT score you will get into at least one medical school (not even a DO school). I come from a family of doctors and can assure you that residency and fellowship are way more important than medical school anyway. You could go easily go to a state medical school and still get an amazing residency program and become a top doctor. So try to stay positive and realize that you are still doing rather well. Your goals are still very attainable.

VCurrently a freshman thinking about majoring in Computer Science A.B. However, I'm feeling discouraged. I took COS 126 last semester and I got a C+, almost a B-. However, I acknowledge that it was my fault because I didn't really do the readings or study. This semester, I did all the readings and watched all the videos for COS 226. However, I'm not doing well on practice written exams. I can program fine but the theory is hard. I don't want to kill my GPA for something that wasn't meant for me.

Location is kind of inconvenient for some people unless you\u2019re an athlete / most of your classes are in the south part of campus.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aSo first I just want to say that freshman year science classes can be shitty and not indicative whatsoever of what the sciences are actually like. There are definitely some students that enjoy these classes, but there are also many who don\u2019t. If you dream of working for NASA or being a surgeon, it can be pretty boring to sit through intro physics or chem. In my opinion, it\u2019s completely understandable to not be super interested in these classes. Also, the curves in these types of classes can suck, which could explain the sense of incompetency you feel (I promise you\u2019re not incompetent!). \u000aI would still consider taking some science classes/working towards your major next year, because you\u2019ll likely be able to move away from the large intro classes and focus on more specialized courses that might invigorate you. If you really want to be a science major, don\u2019t let the prereqs detract from that! This is true for any major- for example, I hated ECO 100 and got a poor grade in it, but am still going to be a WWS major! \u000aThat being said, it might be a good idea to take some different classes too and see if you love them enough to change academic paths. I personally wasn\u2019t sure what I was going to major in until I took HIS 384, which really made me realize that I\u2019m just super passionate about human rights issues and politics. That inspired me to do Woody Woo! Think about what you\u2019re interested in outside of science. Is it art? History? Politics? Philosophy? Then look in the course offerings and see what the upcoming classes are, and how they\u2019ve been reviewed. Anything with a 4.5ish in the reviews is probably going to be an amazing class! If you have any more specific topics that you\u2019re interested in, feel free to submit them, and I\u2019d be happy to ask around and find some classes to recommend. Good luck! :)

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aHow low is low? If it\u2019s not too awful, there will probably be some small singles left by the time you draw. For example, one of my junior friends was about 2/3 of the way down in draw times last year, and got a fairly decent single in the slums. She said when she chose it, there were still 8 singles left after her. If there are no singles left and your draw group draws into res college housing, you\u2019ll be able to drop to a lower draw time and join a different group, and then draw into a larger room. This is what @ Nick did last year lol. If the situation gets really bad, you can not choose a room and go on the waitlist, but there\u2019s no guarantees as to what your living situation will look like. I know people who have done this who got put in really nice singles, and others who got put in shitty doubles with random roommates. Waitlist is ordered in the order of your original draw time. Good luck!

The main reasons are a significant drop in grades, getting caught lying on your application, serious disciplinary charges, or committing crimes. I\u2019ve heard about it twice, though neither was a prefrosh at Princeton. At my high school, there was a kid who was supposed to go to Lehigh, but he plagiarized an English paper and was expelled, so then his admission was rescinded. The other case of it that I\u2019ve heard of involved a friend of a friend who was supposed to go to Columbia, but got caught taking the SAT and writing essays for people in exchange for sex, money, and/or drugs.

VResponse from Exupery:\u000aThis is a tough situation, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this! It\u2019s good you\u2019ve realized your friends are toxic while you still have plenty of time left at Princeton. I think the key here is to surround yourself with new people and to keep yourself busy \u2013 sort of like when you\u2019re going through a break-up! You should also try to reach out to as many support systems as you can, for instance your RCA, your CA/OA leader, maybe CPS if you want to just sort of talk it all out with a neutral third-party. \u000aSpecific advice for actually keeping yourself busy and surrounding yourself: try to plan tons of stuff to do with any friends or acquaintances who aren\u2019t in that toxic group. You could invite people to do stuff like seeing shows/performances (there are a lot this time of year!), going or start going to the gym with you, attending study breaks, getting together for a movie night, going to see the USG movies, or even just doing homework together. Assuming the toxic group isn\u2019t part of your zee group, take advantage of all the zee group study breaks and dinners. If you feel awkward asking acquaintances to do stuff, start with getting meals together a little more regularly and then ask them to do stuff with you. \u000aYou should also try joining new extracurriculars and maybe dropping old ones if you don\u2019t enjoy them that much and/or if a lot of the toxic friend group is involved. (Obviously don\u2019t rush to quit something you love just because shitty people are there \u2013 sit on the decision for a while.) The easiest way to make friends is through DOING something together. If you\u2019re BSE or science-minded, there are a lot of project-based groups looking for members. If you like performing or are open to trying it out, Lobster Club (improv comedy), Acapellago (a capella), and Band (band) all take people with literally 0 experience, no audition. (Like, for real. Band will apparently teach you instruments from scratch, and almost all of LC starts as complete beginners.) I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other stuff out there \u2013 would really welcome any suggestions from people reading this!\u000aFinally, as for actually cutting off the toxic friends \u2013 I would personally go about through a slow fade. Just respond less or more slowly to texts, stop being active in any group chats, make excuses not to come to events. But I\u2019m also super non-confrontational, and a lot of this would also depend heavily on the context, so I would take my advice on this with a big grain of salt.\u000aBest of luck <3 \u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aJust to tack on something small - make sure you\u2019re being honest with yourself and with your friends. For me, this has led to the recovery of friendships that I thought were on the rocks. On the flip-side, not being completely honest has really thwarted some others. Good luck, pal.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aI suggest that you start by compiling a list of the main themes that the professor has discussed in class. These are the overarching ideas \u2013 there should only be a couple \u2013 and you can pick up on them from the phrases they use really frequently. They\u2019ll probably be drawing your attention, whether directly or indirectly, to how the facts they discuss fit into those themes. If they aren\u2019t doing that for some reason, then you can look at major topics (e.g., \u201creligion,\u201d \u201cpolitics,\u201d \u201cwarfare,\u201d or whatever) and decide on the themes that you think make sense. Once you have that, you can start going through your notes and readings, fitting each detail (e.g., a particular battle, a person, a piece of artwork, a reading\u2019s main idea, or whatever) into one or more theme(s) and thinking about how it connects to the class as a whole. (This would be the \u201csignificance\u201d when you\u2019re doing IDs). Once you do that, memorize the dates/places/basics of all of your little details so that you can sprinkle them throughout your essays and blow your preceptor away with how good you are at thinking about big themes and also recalling important facts :P\u000aMost essays are going to focus on a class theme and require you to synthesize a bunch of facts and write a compelling thesis about it. Doing all of this will really prepare you for that kind of question.

I re did every problem set before each exam (after going through and re-taking notes on all my lecture notes). The other 40% of the exams was harder / you wouldn\u2019t necessarily get right if all you knew how to do was the psets. Then I did the practice exam. There\u2019s really not much else to do, but this study method got me an A-, which I was pretty proud of given the difficulty of the course (at least it was difficult to me).

VResponse from Edamame:\u000aYep you can, just email one of the officers. If you want to drop your eating club, the easiest way is to wait for your contract to expire and then tell the officers that you don\u2019t want to continue to be a member of the club. Some clubs won\u2019t care about the whole contract thing, but some do, especially those with low/dropping membership numbers; I\u2019ve heard of friends having a hard time leaving Cloister, Charter, and Terrace (not that Terrace has low membership numbers, but still). If you commit to a contract and pay the dues for the whole year, you very well might not get your dues back. You can tell them any time you want.

Last Wednesday we got 3 calls between 11 and 7 am, which was pretty abnormal. And I\u2019d say that Wednesday nights are pretty quiet (no drunk Princeton kids for one thing; just not a night that you\u2019d expect a lot of calls basically).\u000a\u000aAs far as intensity, I\u2019d say the majority of calls are either drunk princeton students or elderly patients having trouble breathing/feeling sick/chest pain. There\u2019s definitely the occasional severe emergency. I\u2019ve been on one call that was incredibly intense.

HPA (Kate and Jessica [I think that\u2019s her name]) are indeed v helpful, although I think I\u2019ve had better convos with Jessica than Kate. They\u2019ll run you through options and you literally have so many! I have a friend whose freshman GPA was not great at all and now she\u2019s killing the med school game. Hang in there!

You are almost 50% of the way through your princeton experience and there is still time to get your gpa better for jobs. Especially in finance and consulting, work experience, team work skills, and interviewing skills are much more important. \u000aYou have to look introspectively and think about what is causing the academic issues. Scheduling? Time management?(usually the culprit? Are you starting as early as possible on every paper and pset? Do you go to office hours for every class? At this point it\u2019s worth noting that you have to work differently that other students

In which case, people would get really mad, because obviously only the people with a lot of money would get good rooms.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aOkay I just want to let you know that this is probably the best thing that I\u2019ve ever seen so thank you for making my day/week/month/year lmao!!!!! So to be honest, I\u2019ve only ever had one goldfish, and it was a present for my seventh birthday. I was so excited to go to the pet store and pick it out but then it had some bizarre infection from my ratchet local pet store and died on the sixth day that I had it which was so traumatizing to first grade me. But maybe you can redeem my goldfish experiences lol?? I honestly think that they\u2019re so cute. Also betta fish are really pretty, and if you don\u2019t want to get a tank, you can keep them in a fish bowl! After my awful goldfish experience, I got three tetra fish, and those things lived for freaking ever. I think the oldest one lived for eleven years (?), which is absolutely insane. They\u2019re not as cute, but easy to keep alive. \u000aOkay so I vote for either the beta or the goldfish (so you can bring my childhood dreams to life!). Yes of course you have my permission to name him Bateman, although real life Bateman would like to add that he is not chubby lol. Have fun with your fish!!! <3

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aSure! Just please note that this is all based on my own experiences, so please take it with a grain of salt. But idk it\u2019s just very clear that many people here are accustomed to living a very different lifestyle than me. For instance, I have to have a part-time job, and can\u2019t afford to eat every single meal on Nassau Street. Dues to different social groups are a big consideration for me. I really can\u2019t afford Lululemon leggings or to go to the latest travel destination every single break. Another really big thing that stands out to me is with summer internships. I personally could never afford to do an unpaid internship or a study abroad program that wasn\u2019t totally paid for. Also, my family has zero connections to any fancy people. I\u2019m always shocked when I hear people say \u201coh yeah my dad got me a summer job at Goldman Sachs\u201d or \u201cXYZ Congressman is an old family friend\u201d or whatever because that is literally unfathomable to me. I think another thing is that I\u2019m really the first person in my family to go to a selective academic school, so translating my experiences back home can be really frustrating. Going to Princeton is a total dream to anyone I ever knew in high school, so it can be difficult for people at home to understand the issues that I have here sometimes. \u000aAnyways, those are just my thoughts. I\u2019m sorry if that sounded bitter or targeted at someone or anything; it really wasn\u2019t intended to. It would be just as wrong for me to make fun of someone about their income as it would for them to make fun of me. I guess at the end of the day, we can\u2019t control where we come from, but we can control how we treat other people, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s important.

So, if the first person in the entire draw hypothetically decided to waitlist themselves, they\u2019d be at the top of the waitlist. No, you don\u2019t pick a room if you\u2019re on the waitlist; that\u2019s the point of the waitlist \u2013 you\u2019re waiting for a room, which you\u2019ll be assigned over the summer. I got to pick from 3.\u000aYou can\u2019t get off the waitlist in another college just to get the room size that you prefer. If there really are no more rooms left that you can draw on your own or with your draw group, then you\u2019ll be randomly assigned one or more roommates and put into whatever room they have left in your res college.

Study more with other students and work together so that you all understand material. Maybe get a learning consultation. Talk to your dean of studies. \u000aAlso make sure you practice good time management. Start psets and papers as early as possible to give you more time. Try to study more effectively rather than just more hours. Cramming is proven to less effective than pacing and reviewing weekly throughout the semester.

Now at Princeton, I work on average 3 hours a day, 4-5 hours on the weekend, and am very very happy with my academic performance.

VResponse from Bateman: \u000aIn my experience, it\u2019s very socioeconomically stratified..definitely an area that has a ways to go. If anything, the bubble makes it more apparent. I\u2019m sure you can avoid it to some extent, but it\u2019s here\u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI think the main thing about Princeton is that it completely redefined the concept of wealth for me. At home, the rich people I knew had doctors or lawyers as parents; here, the rich people I know have CEOs as parents. There are obviously snobby and cliquey people here, as there are at every school, but they are by no means the majority of people. Some of the richest people I know are also the nicest/most down to earth. The main way that I personally notice class differences is in the little ways. Nobody is going to say \u201coh sorry you\u2019re to poor to hang out with us\u201d, but you can notice class differences in more subtle behaviors. I also think that the social scene can be kind of divided at times, and some of it can be related to class. It\u2019s easier for people who went to high school with a lot of people coming here to meet upperclassmen, get passes, stay in their same social circle, etc. In that sense, class can be a little bit linked to self-selecting social groups for some people, but again, I don\u2019t think that this is something that you wouldn\u2019t see at similar schools (final clubs, secret societies, etc.) and it is very easy to find wealthy people here who are genuinely nice. Income isn\u2019t something that a lot of people talk about that often- like I said, you definitely notice the differences in the little ways. If anything, I think the bubble makes it worse, because it can be hard to get out.

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly demanding. Most majors here are demanding junior year. MOL has a junior sem in the fall (2 JPs in the fall for that), and then a third JP in the spring. I\u2019m also being expected to come into my new lab about 10 hours per week. Junior year is rough for everyone!\u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI think it\u2019s one of the more challenging social science majors, but not impossible by any means. The main thing with Woody Woo is that it has a lot of requirements. There are four prereqs, five core classes, four electives, all the junior year stuff, and an extra language requirement. So it does add up to be a lot. I will say that a lot of the requirements are very easy to fulfill. For example, I fulfilled almost all of my electives, prereqs, and a few core classes on accident just by taking classes I was interested in (which is how I\u2019m so far ahead on departmentals). There\u2019s also a huge variety in the classes that you can take to fulfill your departmentals. Most of the core classes have between five and ten options that you can take for each requirement (with the exception of econ), and there\u2019s a list of like 200 electives that you can take. Therefore, I think you can really choose what you\u2019re interested in learning about\u2026 it\u2019s very easy to customize your degree to your interests. \u000aAs far as individual classes go, I think the main courses that tend to trip people up are micro and stats. I took ECO 100 in the fall and didn\u2019t like it at all, and will have to take an upper-level micro class at some point. I\u2019m in stats right now, and I actually really really enjoy the class surprisingly haha. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable at all (although we will see if my opinion changes post-midterm grades).\u000aI guess my opinion on the major is that it is by no means too hard that you shouldn\u2019t choose it if you\u2019re interested in the major, but it\u2019s probably too intensive to choose if you\u2019re not interested in it at all. I personally probably wouldn\u2019t want to take extra languages or econ if I wasn\u2019t interested in Woody Woo. It\u2019s just a lot of classes\u2026 idk my advice would be that you shouldn\u2019t take 14+ classes on a subject that you don\u2019t like. But if you are interested in it, I think it\u2019s a really cool department and I would recommend! :)

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for your friend to outline the paper or be more involved than in the brainstorming / editing process. The writing and ideas have to be all yours, but talking through the topic with a friend is probably fine unless the professor specifically forbids it. Also, I might shy away from doing this in a midterm/final paper setting. If it\u2019s a big paper like that, I\u2019d ask the professor maybe?

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI am so happy here and can\u2019t really complain about anything (except relationship status, but that\u2019s another story). I love my courses, the professors, the social scene, clubs, campus, and doing day trips to NYC. I feel that I am throughly exploring all of my intellectual interests, learning new things, and still will be excellently prepared for a career in whatever I pursue.\u000aI think the grades issue is something that affects a significant number of people and whether or not you\u2019ll be able to explore other interests outside of academics depends on your attitude. You are right to be somewhat worried, but you have to be introspective and understand a few things.\u000aFirst off, a lot of people who come to Princeton aren\u2019t used to accepting failure. They aren\u2019t used to working very very hard and getting a B, not being top anymore, and not getting into every exclusive club. Some people are unhappy because of this and whether or not that is justified is not relevant to this question. Princeton is tough, but in my opinion, still very manageable if you use your time wisely. The courses are tougher than at other places, the writing is tougher, and the people around you are the top in the world. \u000aBut It sounds like you are too worried about grades, which is a good thing. Don\u2019t come here expecting all A\u2019s. The workload and intensity is mainly perception and will depend on what you want to get out of your college experience.

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aHonestly classes change so much from semester to semester that it is pretty useless to try to plan out any semesters before classes are released. Just figure out when you need to take the requirements for your major and any certificates, and then when classes come out for the next semester, fill in the gaps with stuff that sounds interesting.\u000aResponse from Winnie P:\u000aPSH SO NOT TRUE. There\u2019s frequently patterns for when courses are offered and you can also email profs to ask. I recommend spreadsheets and color coding. I have spent literally hours every semester working on mine and it is beautiful and I am supremely satisfied with my future trajectory for all 4 years (with a little bit of room for improv). It can never hurt to play around with that type of stuff at least!

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000a@Mia if I left this in the inbox long enough would you answer it lolol.  \u000aBut Grindr hookups are generally not great. It\u2019s really nothing to get nervous about though, at least in my opinion. I haven\u2019t hooked up with someone from Grindr in awhile because I never really get anything positive from it. Usually you chat with the random human on the app for awhile. Get their \u201cstats,\u201d \u201cwhat they\u2019re looking for,\u201d exchange pics\u2026 If you decide to meet up someone goes to the other person\u2019s room (usually a blunt \u201cwant to meet up\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m horny\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s hook up\u201d initiates this phase of the Grindr hookup). You usually engage in awkward small talk for like 15 minutes even though neither person really has any interest in befriending the other guy. Then someone sort of makes a move to start hooking up (usually initiated while the two humans are on the bed\u2026perhaps involves some leg touching/feeling)?? And things progress very speedily. Lots of guys would end up having sex (or doing whatever they\u2019re comfortable with if you\u2019re not into that, which is totally fine; I\u2019d never have sex with a rando I met on Grindr). Then you awkwardly leave once it\u2019s over. Honestly it\u2019s nothing special, but if you\u2019re wildly horny, there are guys on Grindr to meet your needs. Stay safe bud! \u000aResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aHonestly probably yes lmao

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aFirst think about what academics you are interested. If you want to be an engineer for example, Princeton is objectively better. I am sure Harvard is better for other things, idk what they are. Maybe premed/prelaw? \u000aThe most important thing to do is to visit them, get a feel for the campus and talk to students there. Honestly, I think Harvard feels super strange. The campus feels like it has no personality and everyone is pretending to be Harvard students, if that makes any sense? I\u2019ve gone there two or three times with the band and it\u2019s a really bizarre feeling that I don\u2019t experience at any other school. \u000aAlso think about setting, Princeton is decidedly suburban whereas Harvard has very easy access to Boston. Neither is objectively better than the other, just think about where you feel you would be happiest.\u000aUltimately you can\u2019t really make a wrong choice, but I hope this might give you something to think about as you do more research and visit.\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI remember being in your shoes. Man time flies. But anyways, I got accepted into Brown, Princeton, Cornell, Penn, and Williams. My decision to come to Princeton rested on several factors. First of all the campus and feeling of the student body. I really didn\u2019t want to live directly in a city, I wanted a suburban feeling. I like having a nice, quiet, area, with a small number of people where I I always see someone I know when I go around. I wanted the social scene and activities to be focused on campus. And no absurd fraternity level drinking. Some people (like my friend at Columbia) may think that\u2019s boring and you may be one of them so consider that when choosing. I find that a lot of NYC people don\u2019t like the campus and miss the city. I personally love it, and even when I want the city, it\u2019s only an hour away. Second, Princeton has a very small undergraduate population and an even smaller graduate population. Professors here are really here for the undergrads, we get a lot of attention, and we have very good support for us. I have had lecturers who never got promoted because they care about teaching more than publishing. Harvard on the other hand, has more graduates than undergraduates and you can easily be forgotten. One of my friends at Harvard told me \u201cyou really have to put yourself out there\u201d and also that several professors don\u2019t really want to teach undergrads. They just have to as part of their duties as professors. I also really wanted a liberal arts education, which made me turn down Wharton. \u000aNow for some arguments against Princeton in favor of Harvard. First of all the thesis and requirements. Princeton is objectively harder than Harvard and that may affect you decision depending on how much you want inflated grades, your attitude, and your ability to handle anxiety and stress. This shouldn\u2019t be the only factor, but it\u2019s worth saying that it\u2019s probably easier to experience the non-academic rewards of college at Harvard. At Princeton, about 1/3rd of all students say that are overwhelmed academically, socially, emotionally, etc. At Harvard, it\u2019s like 20%. That\u2019s not to say Harvard is a joke. The best way I can sum it up is that at Harvard if you work your hardest in a course you will be rewarded with an A, at Princeton if you work your hardest you can still end up with a B. If you want to come to Princeton, you shouldn\u2019t have an attitude that you\u2019ll still be number 1 in everything, that you need to get all A\u2019s, and you\u2019ll get accepted into most of the clubs you apply for. Princeton takes people down a notch, while Harvard tends to inflate egos further. This leads to another issue which is if you want to go to grad school. I know it may make some people uncomfortable, but Harvard is better if you are pre-med for example. Med-schools like the highest grades possible. Princeton will put you at a disadvantage and you\u2019ll have to work harder to the point of insanity for some people if you want to be in good shape. Of course there are exceptions (like Nick), but they are in the minority and there\u2019s no way to predict how you will fare here as a pre-frosh. \u000aThere\u2019s a reason why our (and UChicago and Columbia) pre-med acceptance rate is so high. It\u2019s because the advisors tell a huge number of prospective pre-meds to not even apply because they have no chance. They get weeded out. As someone who comes from a family of doctors let me also tell you this. Nobody cares where you did you undergraduate degree if you want to be a doctor. Med school, residency, and fellowships are 10 times more important. I can only recommend Princeton to a pre-med if they want that excellent liberal arts experience, they will be able to handle the rigor to get the necessary grades and still have a life, the campus, and because they got a good financial aid package. This is because it makes no sense to pay more money for worse grades. You could go to a good state school, l take it easy and get into a top Med school with good MCAT scores. In this case Harvard is probably less stressful. But there are numerous other things to consider. I just scratched the surface. My advice is to keep talking to real students (NOT TOUR GUIDES) and find both the good and bad and see which matches your preferences the best. As Amygdala said, there\u2019s no wrong choice.\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aJust want to add the \u2018successful premed perspective.\u2019 Don\u2019t count Princeton out because you\u2019re premed or prelaw. Med schools and law schools know that Princeton is one of the most rigorous institutions in the country. Though our average premed GPA might be slightly lower than that of Harvard\u2019s, our premed acceptance rate is likely almost equivalent. HPA (that\u2019s health professions advising; the advising system for premeds here) publishes statistics on the average GPAs of Princeton students that get accepted into all the top medical schools each year. Take Harvard med, for example (highly-ranked, consistently top 3). The average GPA of all students accepted to Harvard med is a 3.94. When you look at the average GPA of Princeton students accepted to Harvard med in the past 5 years, it\u2019s a 3.83. This is the case for all of the top med schools. I agree, this place is hard as hell. But if you apply yourself and are serious about the premed path, you can be more than successful here. I don\u2019t know if I agree with the above assertion that all the premeds get \u2018weeded out.\u2019 Is this not the case at every school in classes like orgo and biochem? Most of the premeds I know here are succeeding, even if they\u2019re not hitting a 4.0.

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aOn the surface, Charter is very engineer-heavy (though there are plenty of ABs). Quad has a little of everything. Quad has a subset of conservative/religious members who aren\u2019t particularly vocal or anything but are there if you\u2019re into that. Charter is more close-knit. A lot of people hang out at the club all the time and everyone comes for dinner. Quad often had near-empty dining room for dinner (not sure where everyone else ate tbh?) and the same 10 people were the ones who were around all the time. This may have changed now that they have a lot more people. Both clubs have great alcohol; Charter has more members who regularly consume it. Very generally speaking, Quad seems to be more introverted and Charter more extroverted but there are a ton of exceptions. Both attract pretty laid back, genuine people, especially ones who really like video games.

The group also goes on a national tour every intercession, performs the iconic frosh week show (which is made up of their most popular skits and songs from years past), and performs at Reunions. They\u2019re amazing- check them out on Youtube! PUP is more of a traditional theatre group, and puts on a handful of plays and musicals every year, many of which are directed by students. Additionally, different students and student groups will sometimes sponsor shows. Other groups to check out- Princeton Shakespeare Company, Quipfire!/Fuzzy Dice/Lobster Club (improv comedy), and L\u2019avant-scène (French theatre). There\u2019s also a certificate in Theatre and a lot of really neat classes on the subject if you\u2019re interested in studying it academically!

VResponse from Nick Carraway:\u000aUm, the essay is probably 60% of the midterm grade and the 3 IDs are probably collectively 40% of the grade? This is a total guess but it seems reasonable. I have no idea what it actually is. But assuming this is the case, if you had absolutely no idea what one of the IDs was, you\u2019d lose 13% or so, putting you at a B+ maximum score? \u000aThe essay could also be worth more. Or the IDs could be worth 50% of the grade\u2026 Definitely depends on how points are distributed on the midterm. Also you probably bullshitted something for the ID right?

My worst grade happens to be in my major (so far), and while it was pretty dejecting, I persisted and ended up doing well for a different class. Also seeing how you said it was your intended major means you\u2019re a 1/2nd year - you have lots of time to improve not only in your concentration but also overall improvement in how to study, etc. Also, you\u2019re probably in intro classes, and those aren\u2019t always indicative of what the more advanced classes will be.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aWhile I do understand that they\u2019re being paid extra, I still think it\u2019s wrong. Staff members have families, homes, lives\u2026 they should also have the right to work reasonable hours and not be expected to sleep on a cot in the basement of Frist. At the very least, why haven\u2019t we significantly reduced the number of dining options in an effort to decrease the number of staff required to be on campus? Or, if Princeton is still organizing that midnight meal @ Frist, why can\u2019t they organize a kind of emergency snack//dinner thing and do away with one of the meals in the dhall? Or, why didn\u2019t we just open up dhalls at noon or 5:00 pm like other facilities on campus? Missing one meal, or having to wait in a slightly longer line in a limited number of dhalls, isn\u2019t going to kill any of us.\u000a Just to piggyback, somebody suggested the University releasing credit the day or two before so students could stock up on food. I think that would\u2019ve been fine. No need to keep them here. We can survive for a day.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI have personally never encountered competition or cutthroatness in courses. Most everyone here is collaborative and we all want to succeed together (or in some cases everyone struggles together :). People bond through discussing (or complaining) about classes and overall, I feel the environment is very friendly. Princeton is the place where 9 out of 10 times, someone will take some time out of their busy schedule to help a fellow student out (well at least I try to do that).\u000aThat being said, for sure sometimes I have heard of people feeling somewhat competitive but that is usually for courses that foster terrible atmostpheres like some Chinese classes where the teacher flat out says that only one person is allowed to get an A in the class. Also, some intro econ or sciences courses always have people with more experience than others, which will make the curve less generous. Nothing you can really do about that though and this problem exists at all universities.\u000aResponse from Harvey:\u000aMy experience here at Princeton has been the opposite of competitive and cutthroat. Well, I guess people here are competitive in the sense that they want to do the best they can. But the amount of help, collaboration, and support I\u2019ve gotten from friends and people in class, McGraw, etc. is incredible. I wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in an environment where people around me are trying to cut me down

For most pre-reqs it\u2019s a C (sometimes B for certificates) for the required grade. You still have another half of a semester to pull it up.\u000aEven in the worst case scenario you could talk to an advisor and maybe take the class over the summer or fall of junior year if absolutely necessary.

The scholarships and funds are meant for people to have an easier ability to expand their horizons with new cultural experiences, so they don\u2019t offer them for American universities generally.\u000aSo in the event that you want to take summer courses at an American university, I would recommend that you try and take them at your best state school so that you can get a discount. For me, prior to going to Portugal, I took a linear algebra class at NYU and was able to pay a much lower price due to a family connection. However, if you really want to go a private university, some summer programs also offer forms of financial aid / scholarships at other ivy league institutions.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI do not think that all-nighters are really the norm at all. I\u2019ve pulled maybe 5 in my time here? And most of them could have easily been avoided if I wasn\u2019t procrastinating so often. I\u2019m sure they happen occasionally depending on the person, but unless you have a crazy workload, I\u2019d say that most people get at least 6 hours a night. Tbh most of the nights where I get little sleep are because I\u2019m messing around with my friends or hanging out with people on my hall until really late at night. \u000aResponse from Amygdala: I have never pulled an all-nighter. I get an average of 8 hours of sleep every night, though this was more like 6.5-7 when I was an underclassman.\u000aResponse from Nick Carraway: I\u2019ve also never pulled an all-nighter! Sleep from 2-9:30 usually.\u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aI lean closer to Mia on this one! I don\u2019t know how many I\u2019ve pulled, but I\u2019ll always try to get at least 5 hours of sleep before an exam. Does a crazy amount of learning happen? Not really. It\u2019s more of like an okay-now-I\u2019m-sure-I-covered-everything kind of re-assurance. The last time I came close to pulling an all-nighter, I could have probably finished the assignment earlier, but it was so boring and a friend of mine and I were the only ones in the library and got into this hour-long conversation haha\u000a1000% not the norm!\u000aResponse from Ariel:\u000aI\u2019ve only pulled one this year and the next day was the worst day of fall semester for me. Definitely do not suggest, it sets your entire week back. Last semester I slept 2:30-8:30, this semester 1:30-9:30 and there is a noticeable difference in all parts of my life, those 2 extra hours totally count!\u000aResponse from Ziggy:\u000aJesus y\u2019all have your lives together. I haven\u2019t pulled any this year because senior year is chill af, but I had one maybe every other month my first three years here. It\u2019s definitely not a sign of a good student; I was just inefficient. Now, I sleep 3:30 - 9:30 or 10 and that works really well.

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aOh hi you\u2019re me four years ago. So the really unfortunate truth is\u2026 there\u2019s not really a way to get involved in instrumentation at Princeton. This is mostly the reason that I am going to a real biomedical engineering program for grad school. (I am probably going to be working on creating safer and more permanent brain probes! wooo) The courses and research here are just more focused on science as opposed to design.\u000aThe good news is, if you want to do instrumentation and are perfectly happy to go to grad school, you can study whatever branch of engineering you want. When I visited Rutgers, the people in the BME program came from chemE, mechE, electrical, computer science, chemistry, bio\u2026 anything remotely related is fine. CBE at Princeton is focused on large-scale chemical plants. You will mostly be learning about how to do stuff like refine gasoline. There is not a lot of biological application at least until you get to senior year and you might end up in a bio-based lab for your thesis like I did. If this is not at all interesting to you, look into MAE or ELE. Both will teach you a lot that you could apply to device design later on.

VResponse from Princess Mia:\u000aI would say that it is very easy to overwhelm yourself, but it can most definitely be avoided if you plan accordingly. Taking three labs while playing a varsity sport and performing in a music group is probably not the best idea. Time management is extremely important! I tbh don\u2019t think I am more stressed out here than I was in high school, with the exception of midterms/finals week. \u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aA fair amount of students are stressed out all the time. I think if you are prone to stress, depression, and anxiety that should definitely factor into your decision to come here. Or at least know where to find the right resources ahead of time.\u000aHowever, personally, I don\u2019t really feel that stressed at Princeton. I feel like I have things under control and everything will work out to the extent that I\u2019ll still be satisfied. High school was tougher a lot of the time.\u000aResponse from Pablo:\u000aYeah, for me personally, I think I have stressful days as opposed to being super stressed all the time. There are just those times when EVERYTHING is due (or seems like it is) and then you\u2019ve got that activity you\u2019ve been planning and also those two other things. I think you should be ready for these kinds of days, but I don\u2019t think that has been the general norm.\u000aWhen those days do hit, however, I kind of cheat by not eating as healthily lol.

I wouldn\u2019t say that the seminars will prepare you to write a Pulitzer or anything, but they provide a decent general overview of how to write at the collegiate level. Another thing that I really learned in mine was how to cite sources, which I\u2019d literally never been required to do before Princeton. \u000aEach seminar requires three \u201cRs\u201d or revisions and three \u201cDs\u201d or drafts (\u201dR1\u2033, \u201cD3\u2033, etc are very commonly used as lingo) throughout the semester. There will probably be some readings or smaller writing assignments in between, although the papers, especially the Rs, are by far the most important. Your R3 is weighted the most heavily, and you will also have a short Dean\u2019s Date paper. \u000aSome seminars that are widely perceived as good: Decoding Dress, the Big Apple, the Superhero Trials, the Social and Political Lives of Humor \u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aI personally think Writing Seminars are jokes. Mine didn\u2019t help me at all and was more aggravating than enriching. It wasn\u2019t that it was hard (I actually got invited to be a Writing Center Fellow). I just thought it was so boring and a waste of a class.\u000aWorkload is pretty tough for most people and requires putting in a lot of hours for drafts and even more for revisions if the first versions didn\u2019t come out as well. There is also a final research projects that takes weeks of research, organization of secondary sources, etc. Nothing too much with good time management though. Don\u2019t stress it too much though and you\u2019ll be fine writing in other courses.

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aYou are allowed to live off campus starting during your junior year, so I don\u2019t think you need any authorization from the University to do this. You are only required to be on campus as a freshman/sophomore.

One of my parents has a crippling neurodegenerative disorder and it is easier for me to help with upkeep of home and siblings if I do this. How should I go about requesting this arrangement to administration ?

VResponse from Amygdala:\u000aThere is a lot of structured tutoring for intro-level math and science classes (also Econ) through McGraw Center. You can get a one-on-one tutor (an upperclassman who got a high grade in the class) or you can go to group tutoring sessions made specifically for the class, which vary in how helpful they are but are usually ok. McGraw also has a lot of other resources, one I recommend is getting an individual Learning Consultation where McGraw can help you figure out a study regimen that works best for you.\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aYeah you can come see Me or Pichu at McGraw! I strongly advise coming early as study halls at Frist are jam packed on days before psets. I would also like to add that there are also residential college language tutors (like me) who can help immensely with that required language course. We are an underutilized resource and happy to help.

VResponse from Harvey:\u000aI would say that there\u2019s a good number of Christians on campus! There are 3 main Christian groups (PFA, Manna, PEF), and each is welcoming and open to anyone and everyone. Each group does have its own flair though. In terms of diversity in services, there is a service on Sunday in the chapel, but all the Christians I know who are more serious about their faith go to church services outside campus - people take buses/cars to go to churches that are 10/15/25 mins away. For the music - the student groups are modern contemporary (chris tomlin, matt redman, hillsong, etc.), but it varies for each church. It\u2019s very easy to be involved in Christian groups/activities here, and there\u2019s variety so you can choose where you feel most comfortable!\u000aResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aHey! I remember this question a while ago. Happy to answer it again! Keep them coming with regards to religion!\u000aHarevey did a great job summarizing though. There are several amazing Christian services on campus. We have Princeton Faith and Action (faith based community service), Princeton Evangelical Fellowship (singing, worship, and events), Manna Christian Fellowship, the list goes on. All for people of different secs., different goals, and everything. I\u2019m in PEF and we always welcome more people to come sing and worship!\u000aFinally, to answer the only other aspects of your question. The diversity of the Christian groups is some of the highest of any club/group on campus. We have a high mix of all races and backgrounds from all geographic areas. I met a guy from London actually at PEF. Most conservatives at Princeton are Christian, but within the Christian groups themselves there are huge factions of ardent liberals and everywhere inbetween on the political spectrum.

VResponse from Maybach Renntech:\u000aHahaha. Maybe. We\u2019ll never know and you\u2019re right that it is technically possible. That being said, I think it\u2019s highly unlikely as the person would have 1. done it earlier, 2. anticipated the site coming back anyway.\u000aI\u2019m still holding on to my theory that it was a copyright thing. The day it got taken down, someone posted a picture of the \u201ccashmeoutgirl\u201d from Dr. Phil without a citation and I read that a lot of tumblrs get taken down for this reason. However, usually you get a warning, and the site administrator thinks this is unlikely.

VResponse from Ziggy:\u000aNo idea re: certificate but w/r/t the first question: I don\u2019t think that this alone means that you shouldn\u2019t be a COS major. For reference, I got similar grades in all three introductory classes, but I\u2019ve gotten some form of A in almost all of my upper-level departmentals and independent work stuff. It takes some of us more time than others to learn how to be a good computer science student and to think in the way that CS requires. You should evaluate what caused those grades, but also how much you\u2019ve grown and learned over the past two courses (and whether you think you can keep an upward trajectory going). You should also talk to your preceptor or whomever knows you best from these courses \u2013 they see so many kids, and they probably have a pretty decent gauge of what you\u2019ll be able to handle. I think that there\u2019s also a departmental representative (?) who is meant for pre-majors? Maybe?

VResponse from Bateman:\u000aPlace out of anything you\u2019re able to, especially as an engineer. Most BSE students use placement for math, but physics is much less common. You\u2019ll have a lot more freedom in terms of scheduling your freshman year, which is great. \u000a\u000a\u000aResponse from Pichu:\u000a\u000aPlace out of as much as you can.

VHey! I'm an incoming freshman for next year, planning on doing engineering (probably electrical or comp sci).  I'm just wondering what other engineering students have done in the past with placing out of physics and Calc requirements. I'm currently taking AP Calc BC and physics C so I'm going to take the tests. Pretty much, my question is: do a lot of BSE students place out of these classes? is it beneficial? if they do place out of them, do they succeed or is it best to take them at Princeton?
